this stuff works ,every time i drink  i get the asian flushing really bad  my face would get very splotchy and unattractive  i use to take pepcid ac but now i use bibi s beverage   lighten up and it really works  i wish it wasn t so pricey but i rather take this natural product vs a medication  highly recommend   
this is a great daily cleanse shot i take every morning   ,i purchased this shot as my friend recommended it to me for hangovers  to my pleasant surprise  it tasted really good and was on par with a lot of high end  juice shot  products  the pricing is on par with juice shots  so i just buy them in bulk and take a shot everyday  i am a big fan of charcoal and this is a great way to intake it daily 
natural detoxification using ancient proven ingredi,this product brings back a long ancient history of proven ingredients to help detoxify in the modern age  it helps with ridding the asian glow but also helps detoxify in general using natural ingredients instead of synthesized drugs  like pepcid and zantac   i recommend this for anyone who gets red when they drink or just wanting to help the body detox  especially when drinking alchohol  
effective   yummi,i love red wine  but it makes me have really embarrassing cheek redness and a hot face  it also makes me feel slightly hungover now even to drink small amounts socially as i get older  i am glad i tried bibi because it truly helps with redness  hot cheeks and preventing hangover headaches  it also tastes really great and has a bunch of antioxidants and vitamins in it  i feel like i can still be social and take care of my body using bibi  i definitely recommend you try this 
better and safer than pepcid,bought this for my girlfriend who gets the glow  face  all over her back  and other random places  and has been experimenting with patches and other weird products as of late  none of which have worked and cost more      pepcid works okay but is obviously not the best choice and not the healthiest  so i wanted to try to get her to switch to something healthier  i searched amazon and came across bibi  read through the ingredients  did more research online and it seemed like a safe bet  so i bought a pack on a wed  it came on friday and i  surprised  her with these  as we were going out drinking for a friends bday  she drank two over     hours and experienced no symptoms   no redness  no headache  other than the hangover the day after   nothing  definitely recommend giving this a shot   no pun intended 
this stuff is a life saver   actually works     ,i found this stuff last minute before a friend s bachelor party last weekend  i ve tried many hangover prevention products with little to no success  despite many failing  i ve refused to give up and am grateful for my persistence because to my surprise  this stuff actually works  woohoo  i finally have my long sought after hangover prevention routine  i took both the  nightcap  and  morning after  shots daily  and felt great all weekend  all the guys in my group took turns buying rounds for everyone so we pretty much drank the same amount all weekend  and i was the only person not hating my life on the regular  in fact  i felt great   i m still in awe that this stuff works as well as it does  it s portable  tastes great  and best of all  works like a charm  trust me  it s money well spent  enjoy and play safe party people 
this did not work,this was horrible   the worst tasting in my life  i give it no stars  i tried to chug it and still i basically threw up a little  i got the chills down my back how bad this was  after drinking this vomit drink i felt happy it might work even though the process of drinking it was painful   guess what  it did not work at all  honestly think it made it worse lol got hot and red and itchy like usual and even faster than usual  so let me help you out and do not buy this  i need something to help me out for when i m not wearing makeup and drinking so if any has suggestions please help 
this stuff is amazing     ,i found this stuff last minute before a friend s bachelor party last weekend  i ve tried many hangover prevention products with little to no success  despite many failing  i ve refused to give up and am grateful for my persistence because to my surprise  this stuff actually works  woohoo  i finally have my long sought after hangover prevention routine  i took both the  nightcap  and  morning after  shots daily  and felt great all weekend  all the guys in my group took turns buying rounds for everyone so we pretty much drank the same amount all weekend  and i was the only person not hating my life on the regular  in fact  i felt great   i m still in awe that this stuff works as well as it does  it s portable  tastes great  and best of all  works like a charm  trust me  it s money well spent  enjoy and play safe party people 
highly recommend ,honestly  this product saved me  we all know mixing drinks isn t the way to go  so i had to learn the hard way  the next morning i had a horrible hangover and stomach pain  i took this shot and i felt the effects taking place  i d say about an hour or so i was up and moving around  this definitely helped me out 
my new favorite hangover hack,even just after   glass of wine  i can t seem to shake off that groggy feeling when i wake up the next day  hangovers suck  the past few months i ve been exploring natural remedies to avoid that sluggish feeling the morning after and i m ecstatic that i finally i found my product  initially when i stumbled upon this product i was impressed with the ingredients and i enjoy the fact these are shots vs  big   oz drinks  i m very happy with this discovery and hang them out to my friends all the time after a night of drinking 
my new favorite hangover hack,i cannot afford to be hungover as i have a very busy and social work schedule and found that this really does help my body  detox  overnight after a few drinks  drinking water to stay hydrated is one thing but what really stood out to me is it s packed with great natural ingredients your body definitely appreciates  i always keep one right by my nightstand next to my water   i even sometimes take a shot before bed without having drank alcohol since it s a great way to pack in some nutrients 
pair with the night cap ,hangover induced nausea has a real enemy in this product  i ve used it three times so far  and it has kept the nausea at bay  the color is off putting  but don t worry  it doesn t stain your teeth after you ve washed it down  i found it to be most effective when paired with bibi s night cap product  which is the reason for the   stars  still a great product to keep around  especially if you have things to do after you go out the night before 
works great   ,poor sleep nowadays wrecks me more the next day than the actual hangover  nightcap makes me sleep much better after a night of drinking than any other product i ve tried  most likely due to the magnesium  the other ingredients tremendously reduce the headache and other painful effects the day after  highly recommend   
finally  hangover relief that works  thank you ,after a night of overindulging in a nice bottle of red wine  i woke up feeling less than ideal  i downed a bottle of morning after and was feeling so much better within an hour  i now recommend this product to my friends regularly and keep it on hand for dinner parties  it is surprisingly tasty  i love that it s small enough to fit in my purse just in case i don t make it home or forget to drink it before work  super product  thanks bibi 
best remedy for asian glow ,best product for alcohol redness  i m always embarrassed to drink with friends or coworkers because of how red i get  plus drinking just doesn t make me feel great  this product allows me to drink and socialize with much less redness and negative effects like headache  with this product i can do a few cocktails before feeling flush versus my normal flushing from less than one drink  drink the product    minutes before you plan on having alcohol 
turned a believer out of m,i drank this the night of my   th birthday  and lets just say  i wasn t expecting to feel great the next day  i was very shocked and pleasantly surprised to wake up with no hangover  i was just groggy from the predictable lower quality of sleep one gets after a long night of partying  i had no nausea or headache  both in the morning and later on in the evening when my hangovers usually kick into high gear  i ll definitely be keeping these around 
great  effective hangover cur,gave this a try and was very happy with the results  effective at relieving my hangovers and also contains natural  healthy ingredients  really like the activated charcoal since i usually have an unsettled stomach in the mornings  i have been recommending this to my friends to try  and would recommend it to anyone reading this review 
if you enjoy a drink  this is for you ,love this product  i have been combining it with its sister product  morning after  and the two together are a magical combination  this helps  me fall asleep without the sick headache feeling that comes after drinking  it also helps me wake up feeling much better than usual  this product is worth it and i highly recommend it to alcohol users 
my brain is very vital to my work,as someone working in the finance world my brain has to be on point every day   with money on the line i have no room for error  that being said when july  th rolled around i couldn t resist celebrating americas birthday with a few too many beers  this product saved my monday morning           
would recommend ,i love this product  i am pretty sensitive to  alcohol and feel some degree of a hangover no matter how much i drink  even just one   i have used this so far with varying amounts of alcohol consumption and i find it effective every time  i feel at ease knowing i have this as an option when i wake up feeling nauseous 
sham,it doesn t do anything  i don t notice a single bit of difference  i ve tried morning  before  during   doesn t matter  product doesn t work
worth it,this worked   i was out of town for a wedding and had already booked to do a   mile race   hours away the next morning  with this and some gatorade i felt like a champ the next morning  i wasn t a huge fan of the taste however but it did the job 
rearing to go ,the first time i tried it  i went out and got good and drunk  with work looming early the next morning  it drank a shot of this  a glass of water  and went to bed  i woke up earlier than usual the next morning feeling fully rested and alert  ready to attack the day  it s amazing 
great thing to hav,a great thing to drink if you consumed a little too much the night before  while it is not a magical cure that will not make you feel better instantly it most definitely helps a lot 
no hangover awesome sleep  thanks bibi ,i had friends in town and i handed these out once we got back from the bars one night  everyone was able to get up early for brunch and ready for round two of day drinking  i usually get an awful headache and don t want to roll out of bed  but this drink helped me sleep so i could keep entertaining my guests  will definitely buy again 
did not work ,getting past the horrible egg taste is the first problem  why does it have to taste so bad we asked ourselves  well  if it works maybe i can do it again    maybe  it did not work for me or my husband and i have four bottles that are going to sit in my house forever because it really did taate that bad 
works great ,this formula works wonders for the morning after a long day of drinking  tasted great and did the trick in minutes  felt refreshed and ready for the day  definitely recommend this to anyone waking up with a headache 
didn t waste day hungover in bed  this gave me life ,i get the worst hangovers and usually spend the next day in bed after a night out  i took this the morning after a night of drinking and i was actually able to function and get on with my life  it felt so nice not wasting the day being hungover  i ll definitely be ordering more 
legitimately quite amazing  ,bibi significantly cut down on my usual hangover duration while also giving me an energy boost to partake in sunday funday  i also really liked the taste  something about the tartness and charcoal combined makes it feel and taste healthy after a night out  highly recommend 
indispensable for your active lifestyl,i took the bibi plunge   and you ll be glad if you do too  this is a truly awesome product that helps with mood and recovery  also great as a fitness supplement  it s a  must have  imo 
amazing way to avoid a hangover   ,bibi has been amazing  i ll have it before bed or the morning after having a few drinks  and it always makes me feel so much better  and  the lemonade flavor tastes great  would definitely recommend 
doesn t work for m,maybe it work for others  but not for me 
delicious life saving elixir,if i could afford it i d treat these like daily vitamins and drink one every day  they re wonderful pick me ups after a rough night  and they don t taste bad  go away pepto  you suck   i m prone to terrible hangovers and these make me feel like a human being again 
not for m,i can t get past the horrible egg like taste  even when drunk  i ve tried this together with the morning one  and i don t notice a difference if i just use the morning shot  so no  i personally will not be purchasing again 
tastes great  worked for m,i bought this before a bachelor party weekend  and it worked well  i took one before bed and one in the morning because i drank a lot  and i definitely had a clearer brain and wasn t headachy in the morning  it tasted like a light  natural lemonade  i give it   thumbs up 
amen for these gem,amen for these morning after gems  you never know when a wild tuesday night will show up and you still gotta crush wednesday morning  thank you for existing  bibi    
not working ,tried   bottles  it didnt work for me  wish they sell smaller package so people can try it out  i have nothing to do with rest bottles  
works the best,nightcap works the best for me out of all of bibi s shots  i get bad hangovers  so i m super grateful for bibi for helping me to wake up feeling human  thank you         
passed the age of     this is whatcha need then,i m a professional who is every social  i can t drink like i used to and then perform at work the next day  those thursday evenings that go on too long require this drink the next morning  great stuff  really makes me feel recuper
it works   ,absolutely love it  i ve tried some hangover prevention drinks that taste terrible and have a weird consistency  bibi is yummy and effective 
highly recommended ,highly recommended    after drinking bibi morning after following a big night out  i felt spectacular  tastes great and really works 
it works ,works better than pepcid acid  reduces flush tremendously  no heart palpitations  and no warm feelings  the only thing i would say is the flavor isn t the greatest  but it s an effective product 
saved me from a hangov,took this before a long night of drinking  i normally get the worst hangovers  but i woke up with no headache and felt pretty darn good  now i can drink without dreading how i m going to feel the next day 
just a tasting review,didn t taste anything like strawberry or lychee  smelled foul and tasted even worse  just thinking about it makes me want to gag 
saves the day,i get bad hangovers  so i was hopeful and a bit skeptical   but this brought me back  i combined it with bibi nightcap the night before 
great product,i woke up feeling terrible  after drinking one of the morning after detox shots  and water to wash it down   i felt much better and alert  i love how convenient this is  nobody likes a killer hangover 
really works and enhances quality of sleep ,this is a great product  when i get home after a night out  i head straight to the refrigerator for a quick nightcap shot and like magic i sleep through the night and wake up rested and clear minded  highly recommend 
feeling refreshed ,it use to take me a whole day to get over a hangover  now  i just take a shot of this  and i m ready to go about an hour later  feeling refreshed  it just works 
got this for my gf who turns super red with just one drink ,did two bottles during the night and she didn t get asian glow  she usually uses pepcid  but she said this works better 
great product,seems to work well  took it on vacation and no hangovers 
great mood booster for hangov,really love this stuff  the b vitamins and activated charcoal are great for helping me out when i m hungover  and sometimes i ll drink one of these when i need a shot of energy and mood boost 
it works ,it definitely makes a difference  i ve taken it now a few times after a night of drinking and for sure it s helpful  i basically keep one now always by my nightstand   
does what it say,i m at the age where it s hard to recover after a night out on the town  i need as much help as i can get and this definitely helped  two thumbs up      
you will greatly benefit from taking morning after ,this product works and is filled with great ingredients  it is also a fun party favor for bachelorette parties  birthday celebrations  etc  i love morning after 
works pretty good,works pretty good  but only lasts a few hours then i feel like i need another  but overall  i would buy again 
my favorite so far,it says morning after  but my body feels best when i take it before going to bed  after a night of partying  and for a remedy shot  it actually tastes good 
life saver ,this product is amazing  i ve taken it a few times after drinking the night before  it really clears up the hangover haze  and it also taste really good 
depend,it depends on your diet i feel
expired product,all of the bottles were expired and rancid  will not buy again 
works great ,product arrived quickly and worked really well after a crazy night out  tastes great too  totally recommend 
don t waste your money,did not work and it tastes horr
life chang,i m    years old and get the  asian glow    really bad  my heart races  my face gets beat red and puffy and i get hot  i used to think there was no cure and even though my process is super time consuming and annoying i m so happy i found something that won t make me look like a flaming hot red tomatoe anymore  i take zantac about   hours before drinking which helps coat my stomach  i don t get acid reflux but someone told me it reduced the redness  which is does  but not      i still would get a light flushed look  now with  before elixir  i look completely normal  it s amazing  i used to never ever drink wine because it made me the reddest the fastest and worse but i recently went on a wine tour and took a leap of faith  i wasn t red at all  i will never ever be without before elixir  it has been a tremendous life changer  p s  i drink   bottle   hour before my first drink for the best results 
ohhh the tast,i literally just tried this for the first time tonight  so i won t know effectiveness until tomorrow    but i just had to come here and say    taste wise this was the equivalent to drinking cat pee mixed with smegma    i literally felt my soul leave my body  dear lord i hope this was worth it    
life changing remedy ,this is by far the best hangover relief product out there  if you are like me  and don t drink heavily but still a few drinks lead to feeling like crap the next day  this will change your life  the morning after bibi bev will give you your day back so that you aren t in a world of hangover pain  and lets you carry on with business as usual  if you can  grab some of the night cap to feel extra good the next day  unlike the other products out there  this one actually tastes really good and i wouldn t recommend any thing else  you won t be disappointed 
such a great idea ,me and my friends always tell people about this product and that there is actually a really cool hangover and pre drink remedy available  i think this product is definitely worth a  shot      and if you have the possibility of feeling bad the next day  why not see how your body responds to this  it has definitely worked for me and my friends 
feeling like a teenager again with lighten up,i ve been using this product consistently for   weeks or so now  and notice a huge difference when i drink  i am irish in descent so tend to get fairly read when i consume alcohol  lighten up has helped my redness tremendously  almost to the point where it doesn t happen at all anymore  get on it if you also suffer from redness while you booze 
tasty and kills that morning after fatigue ,yum  this is my favorite of the bibi products  i loved how tart it was and it really gave me the fuel i needed the morning after a loooong night  it also gives you an energetic boost regardless if you drank the night before or not    
its legit,i was skeptical for the      price  however i took the chance and yep next morning after a cigar and a couple brown waters you wake up not feeling like s  t  it does work just down some water and your good the next morning 
you would be silly to not use this   ,nothing quite worse than waking up to a wretched hangover  i ve been using the morning after detox shot for a few weeks now and it s made a big difference in how i feel after a night out on the town  i find the combination of the night shot  followed up by this in the morning  to be particularly potent in preventing severe hangovers 
      would recommend ,i used this after a night out with friends and felt invigorated and serene the morning after  would definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking for a way to stave off hangovers without limiting their alcohol intake  or a good time    
works for flush ,whenever i drink  not even a full drink  i become flushed and hot  i used this for the first time tonight and i had very minimal flushing after   drinks and didnt feel hot and uncomfortable  i definitely reccomend for anyone who gets a similar reaction after drinking 
don t buy this hangover cure when you can buy oth,i ve tried hangover  cures  before and decided to try this one out  don t do it  it literally tastes so bad  the reason that it s a hangover cure is that you will throw up everything you drank during the night  it tastes like a full trash can  also it totally doesn t work  i m still hungover 
life sav,this product has changed the game  i m not a big drinker  but when i do imbibe  i practically always have one of these bad boys lying around  seriously reduces the severity of my hangovers by      try it if you don t believe me 
all the yes ,yummy little vitamin packed detox drink that allows me to have high energy and stay sharp  even after a long night      i highly recommend 
effective morning after  works wonders ,this product is amazing  i ve used it several times now first thing in the morning after a night of drinking and it definitely helped combating the effects of a hangover  highly recommend 
fantastic hangover relief    ,i am tried various products to alleviate my hangovers  this is the one that has worked the best  if you are looking for a fantastic product to provide hangover relief  you should get the bibi morning after alcohol detox shot 
tasted horr,it did aid in recovery  but honestly  it tasted so bad  extremely disgusting taste  not worth it  pass 
great tast,these detox shots always make me feel better than water or even pedialyte  i always keep these on standby  they taste great too  solid   stars from m
this is legit ,this nightcap stuff legitimately works well to lessen the affects of alcohol  after a night of drinking a little too much i could definitely tell a difference using this product versus times when i just drank water before going to sleep  do yourself and your liver a favor and try it  and its all natural which is a plus  and helps your process the alcohol and detox your liver  and its pretty cheap considering you just need one shot of this at the end of the night  for nights when you overdo it a bit  cap off your night with this and you ll feel less like a piece of crap the next day 
works great ,i was skeptical  but gave it a try  took one    minutes before drinking  i didn t care for the taste  but it wasn t much to get down  seemed to work great  had a g   t and was fully able to enjoy it  no flushing  no hot flashes  first time ever i ve drank without going beet red and not feeling so great  most of the time i can t even finish one drink  which is a drag when out with friends  will definitely be keeping this on hand 
is this rancid ,the bottle says       but it smells like it is rancid and it looked like diarrhea when i dumped it down the sink  i wasn t brave enough to try to drink it because if has expired somehow  i ll take my chances with a hangover tomorrow and not some sort of food poisoning  
felt so much better the next day,this is a great way to get back in the game after a night of drinking  i felt a noticeable difference  a lot more energy to be active rather than just laying around hungover  i actually liked the taste too  but i m the kind of person that likes things that taste healthy even though other people don t  because they re used to eating sugar all day long  
does not work as describ,does not work as described  returned the remaining bottles 
seems to work,so far so good  helped take the edge off when i really tie one on lol 
didn t work,i threw up maybe    minutes after drinking it  and still felt sick
