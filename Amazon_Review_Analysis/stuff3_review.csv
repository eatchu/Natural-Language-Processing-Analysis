tastes like the smell of gasolin,the taste is absolutely terrible and i don t feel as if it did anything for my hydration at all  i also agree with the other reviews on here that the matcha sourcing is sketchy  at best  there are far better hydration powders out there with far better ingredient qu
great flavor and another form of coffee ,this drink puts some pep in my step and helpful to my morning routine  great flavor and enjoyable as coffee  i can t wait to taste the hydrated one 
won t disclose source for matcha love the hydration multipli,first  i want to say that i have been using liquid iv hydration multiplier for a couple years now  and love it  it has been a life saver for me  literally  when i ve gotten really sick  i was super excited when they came out with the new energy multiplier  but after asking three separate times  and waiting two weeks  they will not disclose the source of their matcha  matcha is very much known to have high levels of metals depending on the source  this bummed me out  i understand privacy  but you ve unfortunately lost a customer  thankfully  another company with a similar product  energy bomb  disclosed exactly where they get their matcha and that they test it  x for metal levels before packaging  all within an hour of me asking  though i will continue to use the hydration multiplier  i will have to refrain from your energy multiplier 
  star  stay away,honestly  i thought i give liquid iv a try after trying various of different brands  hydrant seems to be the best one  for liquid iv  taste is a huge issue for them  cool packaging with the graphics but i would probably rank them the worst in the market with taste  i also didn t feel great after drinking this product 
great taste  solid energy   quality ingredi,m f  i typically drink a small cup of coffee     yerba mate     mg caffeine    oz  can  a day     pushing    mg of caffeine  daily  this routine was obviously contributing dehydration  which is what originally attracted me to liquid i v  and their triple hydration formula  water alone wasnt providing hydration relief  but rather on a constant loop of water in     water out  purchased the triple hydration formula and i was baffled at the results  which led me to purchasing their liquid i v   energy multiplier  packets  and again i m nothing but impressed with the results thus far  although i may have my small cup of coffee in the am  yerba mate immediatlely got the  axe  and replaced with   pk     mg  of the  energy multiplier  in    oz  of water  flavor is reminiscent of a light  green juice  does not taste artificial or syrupy  and provides great energy throughout the day  additionally  this cut down my daily intake of caffeine  in fluid ounces  by roughly       therefore leaving me with ample time to focus on proper hydr
i love this stuff   ,i ordered this after trying and loving the original liquid iv  i m so impressed  i ve pretty much replaced coffee completely now  i was a coffee drinker for over    years and didn t feel like it helped me awake up at all  there s no crash afterwards  you feel hydrated and alert and refreshed  it tastes great once you get used to the  greenie  taste  it blends ok and you do have to keep stirring it up because some of it floats to the bottom  all in all       
great taste and it works  ,this stuff works   i ve been working from home and my energy levels were just so low   i would get so sleepy after i had my lunch at about   pm so i decided to buy this   i love the taste but it is something i had to get used to which did not take long maybe one or two days   this is a great mid day pick me up      tip  mix it in cold water for better taste    i could drink it with room temp water or cold   by the  rd or  th individual pack i loved the taste of it  
life sav,this product is awesome  i have one pack in the morning and picked me up properly it is different from drinking a cuppa coffee but there s no crash  this flavor could be offputting to some people to me it s great  i m going to purchase this product again 
does the trick   great product   ,this product definitely boosts energy levels  i purchased this because i have cancer and my energy levels were so low due to the chemo  this concoction is powerful and i d suggest taking a few sips first to see how you respond  one prepared bottle lasted me a few days 
feels good in soccer gam,drink in soccer game give me strenth  the price is the only conern  lol
mix with a regular lemon lime iv  ,i agree it sucks not knowing where ingredients are sourced  i also found this to be very bland in flavor   essentially it reminds me of a daily greens kinda mix with a kick of energy  i ended up the second day taking and mixing with one packet of liquid iv lemon lime and it made it taste better in my opinion   i m pretty sure i got the best results out of this product that way  not sure if i will buy again soon or try something else but it was worth the try and    great product just room to improve i feel    
definitely worth a try ,i liked this product well enough  the flavor isn t the greatest  but it s drinkable  i ll be trying others before i choose to stick with this one  but there s a chance i d buy it again  the caffeine felt natural and didn t make me jittery  that part i liked 
liquid iv baby ,i love it  my daughter had a sample and i was very tired  it was the  th of july and i was in a sloth move  so i tried the sample and a burrrrrst of energy all day  i told my brother he tried the sample and loved it  so now all my brothers and my family members are taking both products 
it s perfect and tastes great,love this product
great for pre workout regular morning drink,i have tried several brands of energizing re hydration products and this is my favorite  i like the easy single serving packs  flavor is great  and i feel great after using them  they re a little more expensive than liquid iv s regular packets  but in all fairness it s understandable 
not worth the pric,taste terrible     
nasti,nastiest thing i ve ever had
cost,just wish you got more packets for the money   
not what i expect,disappoint
not work,too much sugar
taste and results ,i just didn t like the taste 
easy to use and good taste  it works ,great taste  good energy  and i feel hydrated  and much better for you than a redbull or soda 
it works ,great way to start the morning  and a small burst of energy mid day 
the flavor is strong and will take getting used to ,i like the product  i would like to see some other flavors 
better than gaterad,better than gaterade and the lemon lime flavor was great 
really work,not my favorite flavor but the amazon long lasting energy it gives me makes it worth it 
can t be healthy with all that sodium ,product had too much sodium 
it works ,the taste could be bett
i m out,yeah if they re not going to talk about where they get their matcha source from i m out 
calm of boost of energi,i started a caffeine detox  and it s been       years since i begun  i m very conscientious about what i consume where it s from  liquid i v a a  berry has been my go to  and has saved me more then on one occasion  this company doesn t necessarily care about profit  they care about impact  they truly wish to make a difference and that s why i like them  today for the first time in       years i ve had caffeine and it was this matcha liquid i v        years ago i would have heart palpitations  today years later  nothing  i felt fine  i even felt safe  i felt a very calming boost of focus  i loved the taste  it didn t smell awful  didn t taste like gasoline  it worked  and i only drank half of the   oz bottle with mix  i ve been on the fence for a few months now  bought it  i really like it   
great taste ,i have been using liquid iv  lemon lime  for many years  the new energy ginger tea flavor is delicious  i find it to be alittle strong so i only put a     pack in my bottle water  keep up the great work  it s been a staple in my life 
great product for wnergi,nothing and i mean nothing gives me energy    but this product which was recommended to me by my friend at work  worked the impossible  i will definitely without a doubt be purchasing more and more  i passed them out to some of my coworkers at work and they even loved them 
a way to stay hydrated that tastes good ,working outside in construction makes it challenging to stay hydrated  water gets to be tiresome  this liquid i v  has good taste   not fruity  not sweet  but refreshing  now i use one every day to go along with the water that is the backbone of hydration  lemon lime is a favorite 
works   but tastes god aw,so i drink the regular liquid iv and love it  tastes great  so i was excited to try the energy version to get off my redbull kick and save a bit of money  and it seems to work  but dear lord the taste  the taste is not good at all  sadly  i won t be buying another bag of it  the normal stuff is great though  i give them   stars 
works great   but the flavor is over pow,i live by liquid iv   was very excited to see they now had an energy version  the energy is great   long lasting  the only reason i am not giving this   stars is due to the flavor  the flavor is over powering and lacks what the other liquid iv flavors offer  i hope they create another flavor soon 
seems to be perfect ,no crash energy and excellent flavor  not excessive caffeine content  no jittery feeling 
yucky tast,ewww    it has a horrible taste  i can t get past a few sips and i m gagging  i had high hopes too 
water is good  with this it s great,works  keeps me hydrated 
love this drink,i take it with me to work  gives me plenty of energy no jitters 
good hydrating drink mix,i really enjoy the ginger   lemon flavor 
taste needs to improv,need to really improve the flavor of both this and the sleep  i am a forever customer of the hydration multiplier but these need work
