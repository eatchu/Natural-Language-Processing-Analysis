reviews are high   inflated due to misleading  bonus bottle  off,reviews are high   inflated because leslabs tricks buyers into reviewing product with a bogus  misleading at best  offer for a  bonus bottle   but the bonus bottle is a hair growth supplement and is far from free 
but i easily drank enough that i would normally be sluggish and    ,i used these  as directed on the bottle  during a music festival in my hometown  i didn t go balls to the wall with my drinking to test them out  but i easily drank enough that i would normally be sluggish and have a headache the morning after  but i woke up early the next day feeling well rested  cooked breakfast for my husband and played tennis  these will be my new go to for nights out  the only reason i m only giving   stars is because i don t know how they hold up if you re going all out 
placebo effect,i was hoping it was a miracle pill like a lot of the reviewers on here made it out to seem  but it has to be a placebo effect  i just finished the whole bottle  using as directed and even taking one pill a day for  liver support   i only drank twice  and both times  the next day i still felt very hungover  it doesn t work  i recommend saving your money 
i m so upset,i was so freaking excited about this  i sent the link to all my friends because they know i get nasty hangovers  followed the direction diligently and went out drinking  i was hung over the whole next day after   orange crushes over a   hour period  very sad
it works       ,so the only reason i bought this is because of all the great reviews  so i ll write one myself  i m     not old  but old enough to feel hangovers much  much more these days  we took a   night trip to nashville with some friends  i realize that nashville is a drinking city and that we d be drinking all   nights  i wasn t necessarily excited about this because i knew i d be wrecked and wouldn t be able to hang all   days of having drinks  i m not proud to say this  but we did get a bit carried away a couple of nights and i got extremely intoxicated  i was very surprised  even after the glowing reviews  that i woke up with no headache  and no other sickly symptoms  such as nausea  heartburn  stomach ache  etc    having drinks at brunch was then super easy because i had no symptoms  i still had the symptoms most mornings of feeling pretty worn out  i still felt like i had drank a lot the night before  i felt tired and a little hazy  but as far as feeling sick like most do when consuming large quantities of alcohol  i was good  a strong cup of cofee and i was feeling well again  we bought two more bottles for our week long trip to hawaii  we wren t drinking large quantities in hawaii like we did in nashville but still found it comforting to have  i found that if we had   to   drinks  taking these pills were great and we d wake up the next morning feeling absolutely       so if you re looking to be irresponsible with your consumption from time to time like i run into  you ll be so thankful to have detoxx working overtime for you to replenish what the alcohol is draining your system of  recommend  read mor
it works      ,coming from someone that gets the worse hangovers ever  like incapacitated for days  tried other things so was a little skeptical  went out and had a lot of drinks  way more than i should  always  but i took   pills before drinking  one during and   before bed and woke up feeling good   i was up and about at noon which never ever happens  even my husband was surprised  i honestly felt      a little of that light headedness  but nothing like how i usually feel  i m gonna try and take the suggested dosage next time  and i will keep this in stock always

i tried this supplement before a night out celebrating my    ,i tried this supplement before a night out celebrating my birthday  i following the directions  taking   before drinking and taking   at the end of the night  i don t think anything is going to miraculously prevent a hangover  but this definitely helped me recover  when i woke up the next morning my hangover was mild  despite the heavy amount of alcohol i drank  the hangover also disappeared much quicker than usual  i will definitely be trying these again 
cure,i rarely leave reviews  but i had to today  i did a walk of shame last night  still a little drunk  literally had to walk because my phone died and i couldn t get an uber  so i m slightly hungover drunk and i m out of breath  finally get home and take   capsules  get in bed and wake up   hours later without a headache  buy these if you re trashy like me and don t want to be hungover   
this really works ,i ordered this before my trip to italy last month as i knew i d probably be having a lot of wine  a couple       capsules before drinking  and before bed  with water  it really helps  i felt better in the morning  and was able to get up and enjoy each day of our trip  after i purchased it  i received an email offering me a free bottle  so i ordered it again  i feel that this is helpful way to take care of myself as i enjoy having wine a few times a week  i do love this stuff

a pure unfair advantag,i wanna start with saying i used this product paired with another hangover remedy called blowfish  results may vary   boy howdy  where to begin  so me and my hetero life partner were planning a   day bender at out buddy s music festival and we knew that we were about to go all   rounds against our livers   dude  how are we gonna stop from getting maaad hangovers  i don t wanna sleep in and miss on the debauchery   i said  deeply concerned  i decided to consult my best pal amazon and found this magical cure all  christ on ice skates  we would hit the bar at   pm for a few rounds of double wells  go back to the hotel  shotgun a cool four count  do a couple shots  drink some md        and continue in such fashion until about  am when it was time for sleepies  i swear on my oakleys  i woke up each following morning at   am  on   hours of sleep  with no hangover or stomach pain  and got right back in the metaphorical saddle of intoxication and bad choices  couldn t have partied any harder if i tried  these two products paired is a gosh darn miracle 
long time drunk   first time us,i drink a lot  more than most and have tried about everything to rebound quick from hangovers over the last    years and this product does absolutely nothing besides maybe give ya some vitamins that are good for ya  just stick to drinking your oj  water  ibuprofen and you ll be    bucks richer  don t buy this crap 
i m pretty sensitive to alcohol to start with,i m pretty sensitive to alcohol to start with  read  pounding headaches while drinking  and crippling hangover the following day  i usually take     pills before drinking and then   after drinking and the hangover is at worst  minimal the next morning  highly recommend this to anyone who wants to drink socially but still needs to be productive the next day   
this stuff actually works ,i was skeptical but figured it was worth a try  and let me say  this stuff works  even when i ve forgotten to take before drinking and only take after  i still feel amazing  i think it somehow lessens the diuretic effect of booze because i don t pee so much in the night  and i wake up barely even knowing i drank  no headache  no nausea  no exhaustion  and i ve definitely over done it and should have woken up sorry 
save your money  drink more water instead  this doesn t work ,does not work at all  as a matter of fact it made my hangover slightly worse  same feeling of when you take a pain pill and it makes you sick and light headed 
amazing hangover reduction ,this was amazing at reducing several hangovers to date  i was able to function  absorb semi difficult information and didn t want to punch my annoying neighbor  now  you have to understand that this won t avoid a hangover altogether  you still have some responsibility to stay hydrated with something other than alcohol  but the reduction in hangover is one i haven t seen in other products  so  bottom line is that it is not a miracle drug that erases our poor decisions from the night before  or the fact that i m getting old and get a hangover from even looking at a glass of wine   but i wouldn t drink without it 
best hangover ever  eagles win super bowl and i felt great ,bought these for the super bowl this year  took pills as directed  watched nick foles and the eagles beat tom brady and the patriots with an open bar  had a great night  had to go to work early the next day  woke up feeling the best i have in years  usually i cannot manage my hangovers  but taking these pills made it much more easier  between having these pills  and being hungover from an eagles super bowl win is was the best hangover ever   best part was when nick foles caught a td pass after brady missed a catch  had an extra beer after that 
bang for your buck this is a good method to get out of hangov,bang for your buck this is a good method to get out of hangovers  or at least reduce them  iv e used this twice now in situations where i should have a massive hangover  and i felt this reduced the hangover time intensity  i use it with  lyteshow    bottles    electrolyte concentrate for rapid rehydration   no sugars  no additives       servings  with magnesium  potassium  zinc     for usage  i would take   pills before drinking or on your first drink  then i would take minimum one pill per two drinks  so in short  after a heavy night of drinking     drinks  you re going to want to take at least   of these with ample water  i recommend this for those that have heavy hangovers  mine used to last until  pm the following day  with this  it lasts in the morning and fades off 
great product with expected result,you can t poison your liver for a whole day and hope that a couple pills makes it all better  this isn t a cure for hangovers but it sure as heck helps you hate the world a little less the next day  i am notorious for puking and wasting the next day away after a night of drinking  with these  i feel better  not      but also not     it is somewhere in the middle  i can at least get out of bed and be a productive part of society  i purchased these because of a week long mexican trip to an all inclusive resort  i figured might as well take a shot and hope it helps  i didn t follow the guidelines to a t since i was drinking for    hours straight every day  instead though i took   pills     times throughout the day instructions say   before drinking    before bed or after drinking   this seemed like a decent median and did it for   days straight  i must say that the amount i drank  would probably have put me under the next day  i was able to slowly but surely get out of bed to get some food and liquids in me at a decent hour in the morning  this help recharge me for another long day of drinking  without these  i honestly don t think that i would have been able to rinse and repeat for   days straight  because of this  i cleaned up the first bottle pretty quick and will definitely be grabbing another for the shelf for emergency use  if your on the fence  it is worth it to help out  they aren t that expensive and if you can remember to take them  they pay for themselves if you add up the time you would probably have been worthless  this isn t a miracle drug for sure but if there was a miracle hangover drug out there  you wouldn t be buying this product  this is a simple and cost effective way to get the water soluble nutrients back into your system that the alcohol flushes out 
no regrets the next morning ,after one fun evening at a work christmas party and two or three to many drinks  i awoke with a beastly hangover  these little pills were a huge game changer after that  after taking these as directed     there was no sad repercussions the next day after going out with some friends  i ve had such amazing luck with these  now i m going to try some more of les labs products  who knows  since this worked splendidly  i have high hopes of the other products  thank you les labs for making an amazingly awesome product 
not hungover but lucid nightmar,for the first time in my life  i have terrifying lucid memorable nightmares only on the nights i take this  been trying to research if it s a common side effect  i m not hungover feeling to be honest  but i ve tested my theory and i only have nightmares when i take these  or i at least  feel  and remember them
high end multivitamin works better for m,better than nothing at all  when drinking and before bed i typically take a high end multivitamin which helps diminish hangovers effects well  i took this product with water and while it helped somewhat the multivitamins seem to work much better  still very tired the morning after drinking no matter what i take 
just don t,i attempted to use these twice now  first off the smell is so bad that it seeps into the suitcase and is impossible to get rid of  outside of that  i took   pills twice  both times i was vomiting within    minutes  my husband tried taking them and had the same results  this was a waste of money  i guess it makes sure you don t get a hangover by forcing you to vomit everything in your system 
have tried it twice   no discernable effect,i gave this a shot because i still like to  go hard  sometimes but i cannot afford to have any type of hangover as it ruins my next day  i tried this supplement twice and followed the directions exactly   did not notice an improvement or really positive outcome from using this  in fact  the second time i tried it  my hangover was worse than normal  even though i drank the same as the first time  i also made sure to drink a lot of water as well to help with dehydration  but still no positive effect from this supplement  disappointing as the reviews made it seem like it worked for so many and i don t currently have liver problems   it just doesn t work for me 
works well when taken as recommended ,i previously took prickly pear  milk thistle and nac for hangovers  those ingredients are proven to aid in hangovers  before  id have to take a separate pill for each one of those  with this  i am able to get all   in just one pill making it more convenient  i take three pills  on a full stomach  before going drinking  then when i get home before bed take   more with a glass of water  i took a star off because of the step of having to take it again after drinking  on some occasions i am drunk and don t remember to take the pills at the end of the night before going to bed passing out  it d be better if i only had to take it once  along with a full stomach  taking this pill in conjunction with a vitamin b pill works well 
the most important thing to know  they work ,i found these on here after reading an article somewhere about how korea has had these little drinkable hangover cures for years and the us is just finally catching up  being in my mid    s  hangovers have become unbearable  the recovery time from drinking to excess without some help feels like a   or   day process sometimes  but i ordered a bottle of these because they had good reviews and the price was right  the first time i took them     the way i felt the next morning  i knew that i would never drink again without taking a couple of these  if you follow the instructions precisely  you ll wake up refreshed as you would on a sober night on the same time of sleep  these things don t fix the feelings of tiredness or lack of focus from staying up too late  but no headaches  no stomach issues  no wanting to crawl back into bed only getting up to collect your takeout from the delivery man  these things work  they work so well  i choose to only take half the suggested dose with a glass of water when i get home  as my big nights out have gotten much smaller as of late  but if you re going hard in the paint all night long  be sure to take the three before going out w a glass of water  have a couple waters throughout the night  and another three when you get home with a glass of water  and you ll wake up feeling refreshed and hangover free  i m on my  rd or  th bottle and every time a friend mentions being hungover  i send them the link to these little magic beans  if you re feeling too old to bear a hangover but not yet old enough to give up nightlife altogether  get yourself some of these les labs detoxx  you won t be disappointed 
not sure what to think of this product  seemed to make me feel weird,i do have to admit that i did not take quite as directed   i didn t start out by taking   capsules before drinking  beer   on several occasions  i took one capsule  and on occasion i took two capsules  before bed after having drank    light beers  on some mornings  i would wake up feeling very unsettled weird  so difficult to describe   i stopped taking them and haven t had any more similar reactions  not sure if coincident or if the ingredients did not agree with me  i also decided i am apprehensive to take something that isn t fda approved   not sure if could cause more problems than help     positive note     i did receive an email from the company stating that this supplement was not a  cure  for hangover symptoms  as it does not make up for dehydration and the symptoms that dehydration can cause  i appreciated their honesty 
it really works ,this is the second anti hangover brand i have tried and it does work  i am a very heavy drinker when i decide to go out and party  i take     with my first drink and lay the bottle on my pillow next to a bottle of water so i remember to take another dose  i still wake up tired but my head is more clear and i don t feel like i want to kill myself  for someone in his   s who drinks like a college frat guy  this works great  wish i had this when i was younger 
hangover relief ,i used this because of old age and not able to handle hangovers  used it a couple of times and one time felt like i couldn t get drunk off beer  just kept a real real real good buzzz going all night  can t complain  even forgot to take before i went drinking and when i got home took the recommended amount after and had a slight hangover but nothing too serious and was able to go to work the next day 
great product for average drink,honestly i don t usually go overboard with my drinking  but this nifty supplement has helped lessen most symptoms of my hangovers since i m getting older  at     i m not as resilient as i was at    unfortunately   i can tell it reduces the headache and uneasy stomach  i have yet to use this when i ve gotten extremely drunk to see how it works under extreme conditions  but so far  i enjoy using it and the extra vitamins are always a plus  drinking or not 
it definitely helps ,as i am getting older  i seem to have no tolerance for hangovers  it totally ruins my day  and i don t even drink that much  i stumbled upon this and tried it after trying a sample size of another product and getting marginal results  this seemed to work better  you certainly won t feel      but much  much improved in energy and mood the next day 
life chang,i am one of those people that suffer from extreme hangovers  even a couple glasses of wine or a couple beers can ruin my entire next day  i m talking  full out migraine  nausea  dizziness  the whole shebang  let me tell you that this product has changed my life  i wish i would have discovered it years ago  it almost completely takes away all of my symptoms with no side effects and no worry about damaging my organs more  i still wake up a little groggy and tired but i ll take that over everything else i used to suffer from  i will never be without this again  buy it 
almost a miracle ,i had a crazy weekend full of drinking and partying in vegas  and i took three pills  as it said on the instructions  before each time i started drinking  i m extremely prone to hangovers  despite staying hydrated or even after just having a drink or two  each time i sobered up  i did feel a little queasy and dehydrated  as expected  but nowhere near the throbbing headaches  vomiting  or heightened sense of smell and taste that i had experienced in the past without taking detoxx  i think i might have even lessened my symptoms if i had remembered to take the pills after drinking with a glass of water  i would highly recommend you try these guys out  especially during crazy party weekends  or even a night out drinking if you re prone to hangovers  they definitely helped me power through what could have been a horrible weekend full of hangovers  don t forget to drink a bunch of water and get your electrolytes in though 
excellent stuff ,this is truly helpful if you plan on drinking a few alcoholic beverages and don t want to feel the awful hangover the next day  the ingredients are non jittery unlike other competitors  i love this stuff and will take two capsules before drinking  and two when i go to bed with lots of water in between  i dont feel like i drank    cups of coffee on this brand  like i did with other hangover remedies   flyby is one  i wake up feeling refreshed  not feeling the pounding headache a hangover usually brings  i swear by this stuff and am ordering another bottle now  for me  i don t drink much  i m kind of a lightweight  so any booze i enjoy usually leaves me groggy the next day  this stuff is such a great help  i can enjoy a few cocktails and still go to work the next day if i take these amazing vitamins  supplements with lots of water  totally worth the price 
whoa  can t believe they worked ,whoa  just    whoa  let me explain  i was blasted  like  can t see  room spinning  on the verge of puking    blasted  somehow before crawling into bed  with one foot on the ground and one hand on the nightstand    to keep from floating off the earth  i remembered to take these pills  the taste in your mouth isn t the best  tastes like supplements  which i don t like at all  but i took   of them  i remembered reading the reviews before purchasing them and they said based on how s   faced you are  it depends on how many you should take  use your judgment  one guy said if he was completely sunk  he doubled how many he took  so i did the same  i doubled how many you should take and drank a huge glass of water  i woke up fine  like  totally normal  i couldn t believe it  i recommend this product all the time  they worked for me  hope they work for you  happy drinking 
well i couldn t get hungover because these pills made me too sick to drink,i wanted to believe    we love going to the lake and day drinking while kayaking and grilling out  but i can t hang like i used to    so imagine my happiness when i read the reviews for this product  it recommends taking   pills but i took   to  test the waters  on our way to the lake     minutes later i was projectile vomiting out of the car window  i felt awful  i didn t drink the whole time at the lake because i was so nauseous  i guess it  cured my hangover   by not allowing me to even have one      awful and non refundable 
works as advertis,at first i couldn t believe the hype  i m a martini drinker and recently have not been able to consume one drink without feeling it the next day  now i can handle two drinks with ease  i follow the instructions  three before i start drinking and three after  i feel amazing in the morning and can t tell that i ve been drinking 
will make you feel even worse ,i have the worse hangovers ever  think of your worst hangover and that s me every single time i drink  i was excited to try these pills  i took them according to directions  you must take   pills total which seems like alot to me  i almost died  if you are looking for a cleanse this is just right for you  trust me  i would never recommend 
great results ,i brought these along to a bachelorette party i was attending and took as suggested  as much as i drank  should have had a hangover  but each morning i woke up refreshed and not feeling like absolute garbage  granted i made sure to drink lots of water and occasionally had pedialyte powder packs throughout the day  but i really feel like these kept me from blowing through my electrolytes and kept me from getting that nausea like i usually do  i m definitley going to be purchasing these again 
so far so good ,i just purchased my first bottle several days ago and have taken it twice  both times i just took   when i had my first drink  then forgot to take more before i went to bed  i know there are many variables when drinking  like how much i eat  how much water i drink  etc  but both times i took detoxx i felt much better the day after drinking  several glasses of wine and a couple mixed drinks  than i have in a long time 
this one s a winner ,i have tried   different hangover pills before coming across detoxx for hangovers  this is the definite winner and i will not switch to anything else  hangover pills are essential as i m over     i have gone all night drinking hard with no issue the next morning  i will be taking a bottle with me on a cruise in a couple of weeks where i will be taking full advantage of the drink package  all other hangover pills have just been okay but this one guarantees me no hangover  at the most  i m just a little slower in the morning but i can drink again that same day  i wouldn t settle for cheaper pills  i would be very hesitant to try another brand after experiencing the fantastic results of this brand 
works most,first off  i bought this before i read through all the reviews and saw where the company will offer to send you a free bottle if you give it a five star review  i m not writing this review for that  i was researching hangover remedies because i had some college friends coming in for the weekend and figured i d be willing to give something a try  one of the recommendations was prickly pear extract  when i googled that  this popped up  i m not a great drinker  i m always hungover  i get the full body hangers  headaches  sometimes throwing up  etc  i took the recommended three pills before i started drinking with a glass of water and three after with a glass of water  i do try to drink a couple glasses of water in between  i drank all day  we started at a brewery and ended at home  so i had a variety of different beers  i woke up the next morning with a mild headache  but didn t have the body hangover  i was still extremely tired and foggy  not the remembering part just the  i drank  feeling   but definitely way more functional than i thought i would be  i don t know if it s just by chance  but i definitely noticed a different  my husband also took the medicine and woke up fine too  overall i m rating this a     stars and definitely think it s worth trying  again  i m not writing a review for the free bottle  although i should because     for    pills seems like a lot to me when it s   just for a night  
we were in the virgin islands so we also had bushwhackers and pain killers which are very sweet and never had a headach,detoxx for hangovers   liver support     vegetarian capsules    with prickly pear  milk thistle  cysteine   electrolyte blend        money back guarantee    these things worked  we just got back from vacation and i we are all in our    s  we work hard and when we go on vacation we play hard and none of us had a hangover  i absolutely could not believe it  no headache  i drank vodka soda s  hubby drank beer    we were in the virgin islands so we also had bushwhackers and pain killers which are very sweet and never had a headache  i may not have been as alert as usual so wouldn t want to risk doing this on a work night but they work 
my third order being shipped tonight ,i m a guy in my    s and i like to drink  i work hard and then i play hard  between the band  sailing and the marina we have a lot of fun  the problem is  i don t bounce back like i used to  and if we drink particularly hard it can take a day or two for me to recover     well ain t nobody got time for that  plus  the horrible feelings of unjustified guilt etc  it s horrible  i have to be sharp by the work time monday  so i tried pretox and the proof is in the pudding  it works  even after a raging all nighter drinking whatever is around  if you follow the instructions  you will find yourself in good shape in the morning  the trick is the planning  you have to take the pre drink pills and then the after drinking before bed pills  now i did find that   for me worked pretty much as well as the recommended    my only gripe is that they are pricey  if you take   on drink night you will go through them pretty quickly  especially if you share them  buuut  last friday i didn t use them  forgot them  ended up at the marina and the vodka came out    oh my god the next day was the pain  so a bit of hair of the dog  so then sunday had to be spent on rest and recuperation  so  i ve just placed my third order  because even though they are a tad pricey  they do work and it s worth it to never feel like last saturday again 
improved my hangover by    ,so i took them before going out  it was a great night  i ended falling asleep and woke up in the middle of the night and the walls were spinning and i felt horrible  i took my allergy pills  also my nose was stuffy  and remembered to take my other two pills with water  i got back in bed and woke up feeling so much better  i went ahead and took aspirin for a slight headache but i m pretty sure if i did not take these pills that i would have not been able to go back to bed so easily 
wow    ,i was skeptical    but i m ordering another bottle as soon as i finish writing this review  do these things eliminate hangovers  no  do they seriously take the edge off  hell yeah  i really believe these have saved me several times now  for me  it seems like the really combat the nausea i tend to get with hangovers  i ve woken up a little headachey and aware that i maybe drank a liiiiiiittle too much   but definitely not suffering as much as i should be  anyway  i m impressed  i m ordering more  i recommend you give it a shot          
they worked for me ,i used them before drinking the night before pride  and they saved me from a hangover  however  i didn t take them the next day and drank again and had a bad night and next day  so  if you re going to commit to taking these and you re drinking two days in a row  take them both days 
this stuff helps  but it s no miracl,i have horrible  dreadful hangovers  and they seem to just continue to get worse the older i get  i usually take   before i start drinking and i try my hardest to remember to take   more after  but sometimes i do forget  i will say compared to the other hangover aids out there  this one is the best  like drinkwel and flyby   i would say activated charcoal has helped the most though  but for loading up on the right vitamins  this eases the hangover  i still feel like crap if i drink a lot  that s just unavoidable  but if i manage to hydrate a lot and eat and get enough rest and take these  i can function the next day  i guess it s just me though   if you don t have horrible hangovers and just a minor headache sleepy feeling  this should get you back to normal  hope this helps 
it works ,i get horrible hangovers  usually even after one or two drinks  that last all day the next day  i just got back from an   day all inclusive vacation  and i d resigned myself to not drinking much so i didn t ruin my time there  didn t really think any supplement could help me  but i gave pretoxx a shot because of the reviews  and brought the bottle with me to try on the trip  since i was drinking all day during the trip  i took three capsules spaced out throughout the day  no hangovers whatsoever in the mornings  even after mixing several alcohols together  and i even felt good enough for a run on the beach almost every morning  i cannot recommend pretoxx enough 
amazing         recommend   ,ok these pills are incredible   i never take the time to write reviews but i had to with these  i get the worst hangovers ever  like horrible and they usually have me out for a day or two with an insane headache  nausea and vomiting  but not this time   i was going to a three day wine event and knew i needed something in order to make it to all three days  i took the pills as instructed on the bottle  with the first three at breakfast around  am  drank wine from then until about  pm when i stopped and had dinner and took another three  i was completely fine throughout the whole day and woke up the next day feeling good and ready to take on another day full of drinking       recommend    
are you a seasoned drinker  this will save your butt ,i drink beer and i drink booze  sometimes i drink way more than a human should  well  in those cases  this stuff stands up to the test  i was very skeptical on this working as i ve tried other so called hangover cures  if i take the   pills before right when i start  slam some water then take   before going to bed  this does definitely work  when i wake up  i m aware i ve been drinking but i feel way more energized and ready to kick some ass and take on the day  ya know  like a normal day of not drinking the night before  so yes  i will keep buying this  cheers   
pretoxx adds a couple extra drinks of buffer between you   your hangov,it s no miracle pill  but it definitely seems to help  here s the results i ve seen in my two drinking days so far  each time i took   before    after    thursday night   half a bottle of wine    glasses of scotch  normally this leads to a pretty decent hangover for me  this time around  i felt pretty much as good as new in the morning  i even went to the gym  saturday  all day    beers  wine  scotch  shots  probably double digit drinks over the course of the day  this usually leaves me non functional the next day  the next morning i still had a hangover  but it was tolerable  and went away by afternoon  conclusion  pretoxx seems to add a couple extra drinks of buffer between you and your hangov
feeling good ,at first i was skeptical  but figured no harm    i tried it as soon as i got it  as i had a party that evening  it didn t eliminate my hangover but seemed to lessen the severity of some symptoms  i was a little disappointed that it wasn t a quick fix to my current state  i started taking a capsule daily as part of my regimen  and have noticed that it has significantly helped  last night i drank throughout the night and switched up what i was drinking  vodka  whiskey  cider   i thought i was going to be miserable today  to my surprise  i got up with no problem and feel like i got decent rest  i can only attribute it to taking this the last couple weeks 
it actually works ,i tried these as a  why not  for my friends bachelorette party in vegas and let me tell you  it really works  we were drinking from the moment we woke up  until our heads hit the pillow  which was honestly for     hours each day   considering we didn t even have any sleep  these proved to do the trick  it says take   before and   after  i only took two each time and it worked 
it really works ,my wife and i were about to go on a cruise with some friends and knew there would be some heavy drinking going on  we took pretoxx exactly like the directions stated  holy moly   we felt great every morning while our friends would slowly roll out of bed  we never had any hangover symptoms  i highly recommend getting this 
    drinking a beer or two i would get a bad headache the next morning sometimes turning into a migrain,after drinking a beer or two i would get a bad headache the next morning sometimes turning into a migraine  i was going on vacation and wanted to be able to drink  ordered these not thinking they d do anything but i was pleasantly surprised  took as recommended when drinking and daily before vacation  woke up feeling great every morning  definitely recommend 
simply put  this s    works ,simply put  this s    works  the weekend prior to my first time using pretoxx i had quite possibly the worst hangover i ve ever had and was out of commission for about two solid days before i could get back to functioning like a human being  knowing that i would be going to a bachelor party in new orleans with my boys the following weekend  i knew i never wanted to feel that way again so i bought some pretoxx  with all of the hardcore drinking and drug use we did not one of us got hungover the whole weekend  granted  you ll still get tipsy and still blackout but you ll wake up a little fuzzy and ready for brunch without the puking and headaches  as i m now in my   s  recovering from a night of drinking is harder to do so buy some pretoxx    you won t regret it 
i m sure if i took them and then had like   or   drinks they d work like a charm,these definitely do help  but you have to also remember to take electrolytes and hydrate  they re not miracle pills but they do help a lot  i m sure if i took them and then had like   or   drinks they d work like a charm  generally though  when i think to take these its cuz i m going out to really party for the night  haha  if you don t drink very much in the night  just taking one or two after helps you avoid small hangovers  i definitely recommend  but use with caution because i ended up partying a lot more than usual last summer cuz i rarely had a hangover to remind me i shouldn t go out   or   times a week  lol and now i really need to hit the gym  p
make such a difference ,i am a lightweight when it comes to drinking and i used to constantly suffer from headaches from simply having a few sips of alcohol  but with these pills  it is seriously life changing  i am able to take the necessary amount before i start drinking and then when i m done  or maybe the next day if i forget  and i feel completely fine  i used to think that i would never be able to drink again  but these are seriously game changers  taste wise  they don t bother me but they do have a slightly different flavor that i can t really put my finger on  but i will absolutely be ordering these again 
three mornings straight i woke up feeling way better than i typically would given a full day of    ,this is the only review i ve ever felt compelled to write despite tons of amazon purchases  i figured these wouldn t do anything but it was worth a shot with a music festival coming up  long story short  three mornings straight i woke up feeling way better than i typically would given a full day of drinking in    degree heat and minimal sleep  i usually get bad headaches and they were completely gone  obviously if you drink a ton they re not going to work as well but it was an amazing change from just trying to drink lots of water  my friends tried them and noticed similar results  will be buying more of these 
i think it works ,it feels like of like a placebo but i genuinely enjoy taking them when i m out drinking on the weekends  plus all my friends digg it too haha  i pass the capsules out like candy  already ran through my first bottle in just two weeks  will buy more 
tested and approved  will be a lifetime customer ,in my    s now and hangovers are starting to get very real  took this down to cancun with me for luke bryan s crash my playa for   days  drank very heavy every day and had very very little water intake  only the occasional bottle of water  and this pretoxx stuff worked marvelously  took it just as directed  before and after drinkin  nothing even close that resembled a hangover  felt great waking up everyday just to do it all over again  i m very loyal to stuff that actually works  so ordered a few more bottles just now to get me through the year  cheers 
you get what you tak,nope  didn t work for me with some cheap vodka and a weekend of blah  i ll keep on taking the supplement on a daily basis for liver function  but if you have a big night out and follow the directions  nothing will happen 
tried it the first night i got it and so far so good ,product came in a timely fashion  used it the first night it came to test and see if it would combat any hangover symptoms or at the very least lessen them  it worked very well  i plan on making this a regular thing on drinking nights  i don t know if it was a fluke or not and will update if it was but i m thinking positive that this will be something that works on a regular basis 
doesnt taste as others ive tri,i always get really bad hangovers  ive used several products for the past   years  of which some were patches  which i didnt like  they smell to vitamin pills and didnt work as good as this pills and others ive tried    with the other pills ive tried ive always burped with them with a really bad after taste  thing that didnt happen with this ones  
a must hav,much more manageable hangovers  if any at all  bought to try over my over indulgent holiday drinking schedule  woke up every morning after consuming       drinks and went to the gym feeling fine  seriously  i cannot recommend any higher  started letting my friends try  be prepared for the improved sales  only downside is   pills before    pills after  meaning this bottle is only good for ten nights 
definitely worth the purchas,like i tell my husband    this wont cure the impossible  but it definitely does help  this has definitely helped minimize   reduce my hangovers a noticeable amount    and i m notorious for getting the most horrific hangovers you could ever imagine  i finally convinced my husband to try it also  and he now won t go drinking without taking these  i highly recommend them to everyone  but do be aware    the capsules are large and do not smell or taste pleasant at all  in fact  if you belch you may continue to taste them the rest of the night  but hey  i ll take the rancid burps for a night any day if it prevents me from being on my death bed the entire next day 
best alcoholic friend  ,i not only like the fact that it got rid of my hangover but in addition all the vitamins and supplements in the product are amazing  i didn t feel dehydrated or crappy the next day  i actually felt better than i usually do 
magic,this is a tiny bottle of magic  even if you forget to take them before you drink    if these bad boys with a glass of water before bed and you will feel waaay better than you would have otherwise  i ve put these things to the test   shots i don t typically do well with and all   and these pills are officially a must 
they work ,was pretty skeptical because my husband gets pretty bad hangovers and headaches  i gave it a try and took them to mexico with us  these are amazing and a lifesaver   we both took them each day and they worked  i m definitely continuing to buy these for our once a month act like we re    year old again days   
survived vegas ,so let me start off by saying that i am a lightweight and can feel the hangover kicking in after   drinks  i don t drink often because of my   day hangovers  i went on a girls trip to vegas and was scared i wasn t going to survive but i took these pills as instructed and let s just say i was alive after my first night of drinking    of us killed   bottles of tequila in half hour   i woke up the next day feeling great and even made it to a roof top pool party 
life saver  so glad i found thi,this is my  rd order in this product and that says a lot  this was a lifesaver in las vegas and now i like to keep it on hand so i can wake up bright eyed and bushy tailed     when i was in las vegas my friends looked at me a little weird and i said it was supposed to prevent a hangover  to make a long story short i was the first one awake and i was ready to party all over again  my favorite thing about pretoxx is when you drink a bit too much your don t have to pay for it the next day  my stomach thanks me in the morning because i don t have that nauseous feeling that keeps me in bed and my body feels good  remember to take them before and after 
detoxx for hangovers  natural supplement for liver support,just started trying these  doesn t do much for a hangover but is full of vitamins  will use them as a daily supplment as it also advertises liver support  my next blood work will determine if this is true 
this plus electrolytes is the perfect hangover prevention tool,i hate hangovers and how they waste my day  but i love wine  so i take these as directed to protect my liver on those evenings i am enjoying one or two glasses of fine cabernet  its amazing how well they work  particularly if i remain hydrated with an electrolyte supplement before bedtime 
definitely helped ,took these for my belize trip  drank every day  some days more than others  took three in the am and three at night and wasn t hungover once  and i always feel some kind of sick after drinking  great product 
hallelujah,i didn t have high hopes for this  but i would ve tried anything to prevent another agonizing hangover  i can t beleive it  it works  thru trial and error i learned you have got to remember to add this in addition to typical hangover prevention    eat  hydrate etc  i carry a bottle in my purse at all times  just in case of emergencies  line those nights where one drink with a coworker turns into     shots and a  am uber ride 
it help,my girlfriend and i have used this a few times now  as i m getting a but older i quite often get hangovers even with having a few drinks  taking this with some water at the end of the night helps get rid of most of the symptoms 
spring break had nothing on these pil,wow  is all my husband and i can say  these pills saved us from hangovers ruining our vacation  drank every night and even when we forgot to take the first dose before drinking and just took them before bed they worked  not one single headache or any hangover symptoms  despite many tequila drinks all week long  still can t belive how well they work
follow the instructions and you should be fine ,i was skeptical at first  as many products claim to prevent or cure hangovers  what i noticed about this product is the focus on prevention before and after drinking  it does recommend that you take   pills before drinking  and   after which can be much at times  when i followed the instructions and drank within limit  i did find this to be effective  if you re going to make the purchase  i would expect it to make miracles  but it is effective 
seems to help,as i have gotten older  i don t bounce back from drinking like i used to  i bought this ahead of a  mom s night out  where we were planning to attend a concert  i am not advocating heavy drinking in general  but if you know you might be having a few more than usual  this is a good little insurance policy for feeling better the next day  i passed this stuff around to attendees  and people generally felt better the next day than expected  don t know if it would help much if you were really going on a bender  but for a little bit of excess  they do seem to offer a boost 
back to drinking guilt free again,i love this product  im in my late    s and hangovers  suffice it is to say are worse than ever  i usually take like   of these pills before going to bed with    mg of ibuprofen if i had about   drinks  if i had more  i would take   pills   you wake up feeling fresh and ready to take on the day  highly recommended  
works for jet lags too,i ve read somewhere that jet lags are similar to hangovers  and as an experiment  i purchased this to deal with my horrendous jet lags that typically last for     weeks  i ve used them   times  popping   pills before each flight from the us to asia and back  i was able to get over my jet lags within   days  not sure if it s really all because of these pills  but so far  it s working for me 
hangover remedi,this product is great to prevent a hangover the next day  i take   caps before drinking    during  and   before bed  depending on how much i drink  and also if i drink in the evening  as opposed to the daytime  or all day  like an all inclusive place   i get hangovers even if i have not had an excessive amount of alcohol  and this product does a pretty good job of preventing that  it doesn t work as well if a large amount of alcohol is taken in 
actually worked for m,i was on the fence about this product as i don t usually believe in any  miracle pills   but after seeing all the positive reviews i decided to give it a chance and it actually works for me  these pills won t take away my headaches from the dehydration on the morning after but i don t get nausea or vomiting which has always been the worst part for me  drinking definitely gets harder as you age but thankfully these exist to help you feel like when you were younger 
waste of money    ,didn t help at all with the hangover  it made me constipated for   days with severe cramps  thought it was coincidence  tried again during a night with friends drinking wine  still woke up dehydrated and terrible headache  again with   days of cramps and constipation  i flushed them down the toilet when i was finally able to go 
didn t work for m,i took these on   different occasions  exactly as instructed  they didn t help me at all  i tried to return them and they are not eligible for returns  which i ve never experienced with any other sellers on amazon  very disappointing  and a total waste of money 
great liver support ,i purchased these to support a healthy liver so i take   daily  in the morning  i can tell i feel better if i drank the night before even with   capsule  i like that i don t feel as dehydrated in the morning  i would definitely recommend this product to others 
get s the job don,i m not a super heavy drinker  but i can definitely tie one on every week or so  this product really helps ease the price of my excesses  i ll typically take two capsules with water while i m having my  fun   and if the night goes long i ll take another two before last call  the next morning i take two with another glass of water  the result is a marked reduction in hangover symptoms and quicker recover  a recommended item for your medicine chest or wet bar 
it may actually work ,used this product over the weekend for the first time  had a couple beers and cocktails at a music festival  woke up the next day feeling normal and was able to get a good workout in an hour after i woke up  this is not typical behavior after a day of drinking  very happy with the product so far 
does not work,didn t work infact it made the day after wors
no more wasted hangover day,i read all the reviews and was thinking if it really works like this it s worth it  i ve been getting hangovers the older i get  but i did try this last night as stated on the bottle  tool   pills before drinking  i felt more energy while drinking and almost like it was harder to get buzzed  in a good way though  the next morning i took   more and i ll say i felt great for the most part today  i d say it reduced the crappy hangover feeling by      which is worth   times the amount of money for this product 
my liver can get all the help it ne,after reading someone else s review saying it was hard to get drunk after ingesting a few of these  i too went through a similar scenario  i eventually got drunk  but it took a lot more alcohol than usual  now i drink as normal and then take   right before i go to sleep  it is not a wonder pill  but it definitely does help the next day  especially if your age starts with a   
definitely works   ,product works great  the directions say take   pills before drinking and   after drinking but i was a little worried about taking that much after reading a few reviews about upset stomachs    before and   after has been more than enough for me and really helps minimize the hangover effects  sometimes i forget to take them before i start drinking and only take them right before bed and they still work 
i wasn t sure what to expect here  i bought    ,i wasn t sure what to expect here  i bought this stuff for a bachelor party  as i am now in my    s and don t have quite the drinking ability of my younger days  this really seemed to help get through   days of heavy drinking 
works great  best value ,i have purchased   different brands of hangover prevention on amazon and this is my favorite  it seems to work the best  flyby also works just as well  however you get double the amount    vs     pils for the same price  so why not go with the brand that gives you more 
works for m,have tried other  chaser   ru    products that worked very well  now with neither of these on the market any longer  decided to try these  i take one tablet after every     drinks depending on what i m enjoying at the time  while drinking beer   tablet  smelly  every   beers work quite well with me and my experiences  i m now finishing my first bottle and am about to order my second  go for it 
after turning    a few years go i realized i couldn t bounce back from drinking like i used to,wow  i can t believe these actually work  but they do  after turning    a few years go i realized i couldn t bounce back from drinking like i used to  i bought these as a  worth a shot  effort and am so glad i did  one note  i do not take these right before bed  only with water at my first drink  the first time i took the second dose before bed i immediately threw them up  this happens to me sometimes with b   and other supplements so i think it is just too much  even without that dose i am so much better then next day  so glad i found these 
bought these for oktoberfest,bought these for me and a buddy for our first trip to germany for oktoberfest  after drinking enough beer to fill a children s swimming pool i can say i have never woke up feeling so great  will certainly buy again 
really works ,wasn t sure if it was a gimmick or not  but decided to try it  to my surprise  it really works  i suffer from pretty bad hangovers and decided to try it  and i must say  i haven t had a hangover yet  and hopefully it will stay that way 
yessss bih    drink that drink    all of them,got married in vegas and had these with me  it was a   day wedding even and boy did these pills work    no hangover     just celebratory times with good ppl and lots of drinks   
it does the job ,i was skeptical at first  but this product truly helps with hangovers  i ve taken it while drinking just beer and or while drinking just liquor  it works  i keep some in my purse at all times to make sure i have it  it works  i promise  the next day i m usually a bit tired  that s natural for me  but that miserable sick feeling is gone 
if you get hangovers this is a hidden gem  wish i knew about it when i was young,i must admit i was very skeptical about this  i m    yrs old now and i tend to get a decent hangover  i take three of these before going out and three when i get home  and i wake up as if nothing  no drinking water throughout the night etc  talked to a friend who s an emt he said it works because of the vitamin b and potassium 
don t leave home without it ,back story  let me start out by saying i have the worst hangovers  i have since college and still do in my   s  my hangovers are not the typical feel like crap  have a headache  and go on about my day kind of hangovers  instead  they include nausea  throwing up miserableness  and i m usually stuck on the couch the entire day  not to mention the day or two after  i still feel crappy  pre toxx discovery  a friend brought over pre toxx during my birthday celebration  i have since used it every time i drink  i usually drink one or both nights on the weekend  and have a good amount      vodka sodas and the occasional shots ordered by friends   since taking pre toxx  my hangovers are minimal to none  i haven t thrown up and i certainly can expect to be off the couch by noon  which is amazing for me  you still need to be diligent and stay hydrated after drinking all night  but in conjunction with pre toxx  you ll feel like a new person  at least i did  usage  i take two capsules before drinking and   more later in the evening  summary  i will never leave home without pre toxx again  i m on my  rd bottle since march  i have turned multiple friends onto this product and they all rave of its success 
still hung ov,ive tried this product twice so far and it did not work for me  i took   before and   after drinking as directed and still had a considerable hangover  im almost     lbs so it may be because im a big guy  it sure seems effective for other reviewers  i ll try four next time 
no more hangovers ,i recently went to vegas and because i am no longer a spring chicken i have the worst hangovers  i wanted to try something that wouldn t have me bed ridden the next day after a night of heavy drinking  pretoxx is a life saver  followed the directions to a t and did not experience any hangover whatsoever 
eye open,the first time  i forgot to take   after drinking and felt a little rough the next day   a lot of beer and jager  the second use i took   before and   after i was tired the next day but did not feel bad at all   a lot of beer and fireball  it does seem to help quite a bit from the usual hangovers where i cannot even open my eyes from the headache 
great supplement to use ,i have been using this product since january      and have been amazed about how well it lets my body not feel the ill effects of a hangover  take as directed though  i have had some mornings where i had a headache  usually due to mixing clears and darks  for the majority of when i use the product it has served me well  when i am drinking with my friends i usually ask if they have considered using a supplement such as pretoxx  and if they haven t i explain my experiences with using it and the effectiveness in reducing or even eliminating hangover symptoms  i first found out about pretoxx from drunk tech review with host mischa pollack  and would not have considered trying it with out the drunk approval for it 
my new drinking companion   ,i took the supplements as directed on two different occasions  both times  i was definitely less impaired with hangover symptoms in the morning  enough so that i am buying another bottle  my only complaint is the pills are large and a bit difficult to swallow 
my new drinking buddy  awesome product ,this stuff is the bomb  take a few pills before you start drinking and then a few before you go to bed and you ll wake up feeling right as rain  make sure to drink plenty of water  of course 
great supplement for those fishing   golf trips with the boys   ,once you hit your    s those hangovers can stick with you a little longer    while i don t turn it on quite like i used to  you know   kids  wife  work   responsibilities  i still enjoy a few   day fishing golf trips with my buds  while this product isn t a cure all it definitely minimizes hangover symptoms if taken as directed along with replenishing with lots of fluids before bed 
it works amazingly wel,i m on vacation in las vegas and i forgot to take the pills before i started drinking but when i got back to my room  after a lot of cocktails at the aerosmith concert  i popped three of these in my mouth and went to bed  i woke up feeling amazing  this never happens to me after a night of drinking  i will always have a bottle of these on hand 
love love love ,i had my doubts  but after reading a few reviews i decided to give it a shot  my husband and i are in our early    s  with a       year old daughter  we ve been to a few weddings this year with an open bar     and let s just say   these pills are amazing  we both woke up feeling great  definitely had to drink a lot of water the next day  but i wasn t nauseous and didn t have a headache  highly recommend buying these 
no longer worth the cost  the product has changed ,i ve loved this product in the past  it was very effective  i am curious to know if they have changed their  formula  because it is no longer as effective as it was and it does not smell the same  the smell was not necessarily enjoyable  but i could put up with it if it made me feel better in the morning  i am no longer willing to spend one dollar a pill on this product  i am willing to spend a lot of money on products that are worth it   but the cost is no longer equal to the value of this product 
i have seen a huge difference using this product     ,i have seen a huge difference using this product  i would wake up tired or sleepy after drinking and i am not feeling it now  trust me  this product works 
did not feel worse lol  but certainly not worth the money,i did not notice any difference in my hangover after using  i used three times to make an accurate assessment and did not see an improvement in how i felt any time  did not feel worse lol  but certainly not worth the money 
it definitely works for me ,had a long weekend with friends in the mountains full of hiking   river fun during the day   plenty of adult beverages at night  and sometimes adult beverages along with the other fun during the day  i took pretoxx before   after drinks and quite honestly never felt hungover at all  i d say that s success 
intensified hangover ,i tried this product by the directions to a t and both times had worse than usual hangovers  i typically don t get crazy bad hangovers but wanted to try something to see if i could get any kind of extra relief after a night out     and i was way worse off  maybe it was just my body    but def won t be trying again 
get more time back in your life with these   ,used these this past weekend for a    bottle share at a friends  needless to say  once i woke up this morning  i was actually ready to do stuff around the house and not be such a slug  definitely like these 
always keep this stocked in your cabinet,amazing product  i was bright  alert  responsive the next day after a heavy night of binge drinking  and my sister was only hungover for     hours  when she is typically catatonic for a whole day  i split the dose into    pills before   during   after because i was worried i would forget the last dose at the end of the night   this method works for me  good luck and godspe
but we like to enjoy a little bit more every now and    ,we are not big drinkers   but we like to enjoy a little bit more every now and then   what we never liked was losing the day after   we tried several  liver  protection we can call it  and by far this is one of the best  of course we added proper food before and plenty of water  i will deffinetly buy it again 
hangover relief ,pretoxx has been a life saving find  after having some wine or a couple beers on a week night i wouldn t get a super bad hangover the next day  no headache  stomachache  etc   but i would feel sluggish and unrested from a lousy nights sleep with my body trying to process the alcohol  now when i take   or   right before  i feel      fine the next day  i can t even tell that i consumed any alcohol  when i know i m in store for a night of drinking on the weekend or barhopping with friends where as the night goes on the drinks seem to keep flowing from the cheapest bottle at the bar or in different assortments consisting of a glass of wine  a tall boy  maybe throw in some sort of vodka mixed drink  and hey why not a shot of fireball to end the night  the perfect mix for a dark and stormy morning    i take   or   pretoxx s for a night like that and i feel so much better than i ever have without it  any hangover symptom that still lingers  lingering symptoms are understandable when drinking heavily  i leave a big mess in my body for pretoxx to clean up and make better by morning  is not even comparable to what could ve been and can be remedied fairly quick by taking a couple more pretoxx to help replenish vitamins and drinking some water  since i ve been taking pretoxx when drinking i think about the fact that i m trying to prevent being hungover and i ve picked up the great habit of drinking more water during the night and that is just an added bonus  i highly recommend pretoxx 
wow,this would have to be the best product that i have fount to help with a hangover  after a night of drinking alot and taking these pills through out that night i woke up with no hangover still thirsty and tired  but i ll take those symptoms anyday 
a must have in the vitamin cabinet ,i will say these pills definitely make a difference  you reach a certain age and realize you can t put them down  or recover like the good ol days  it s important to drink lots of water with these pills  but if you do  you will definitely notice that the minor aches and slowness you would normally have after a handful of cocktails  is pretty much non existent  have bought   bottles now 
take pretoxx in the p m  to prevent hangovers in the a m ,i use this nearly every time i drink  when i do not use it  i definitely notice the difference  feeling so much worse the next day  i typically take   with right before or right after my first drink and   when i am about to go to bed that night  i have not been disappointed  the price also seems a lot better than similar products 
hit or miss,it s hit or miss on these working but they certainly do help alot with the next morning after a long night of drinking whiskey and tequila not sure on b
very impressed ,this stuff seemed to work great  i suffer from chronic migraines and two drinks brings one on the next day for me almost always  i took this stuff all week on a cruise  had many drinks and only got a migraine one of the days which was one of the last  i would say this stuff works very well  i m impressed 
ship it back  you pay,eh  didn t seem to do anything  which is fine and or expected  the obnoxious part is the way they handle their guarantee  they want me to ship back the unused product at my own expense  which is cumbersome and a intentional barrier  wouldn t have tried if i would have known 
amazing product   love it ,words as described for my wife  she woke up feeling wonderful  no hangover at all  she had a slight head ache later in the day but don t know if it even related to drinking some drinks the night before 
seems to work great so far,i was so excited to try this product that i was hungover when it came in the mail  i was mainly dehydrated i think  but i decided to take   pills and chug some more water  i noticed the hangover feeling went away quicker then that usual delayed all day feeling  i look forward to trying it as a preventative measure instead of trying to play catch 
it works      ,these pills are amazing  i was on vacation for a week  i knew i was going to be drinking day and night  i decided to give this bottle a try  took pills as instructed  the next day i woke up feeling great  no hangover or headache  i highly recommend this product  amazing        
great product all natural too ,i love these pills dehydrate me so quickly and make me feel alive and well  although i should be drinking to begin with 
works better than other products on the market ,this worked   i felt a lot less hungover  and feel good that it is helping maintain liver health 
it works ,i believe this product is the real deal  i get  terrible hangovers every time  i drink  i decided to give this a  try on my last cruise  i took as directed and i did not have any headaches  i need another bottle   
non return,you cannot buy this product  try it  and then return if it doesn t work for you  i bought this item   weeks ago and just tried to request a return and it says that this item is not eligible for a return  i should have been advised of this beforehand 
i was amazed  i do this cruise twice a year and    ,i followed directions and took   before i drank    mid way through my binge night and   when i went to bed  on a   day mexico booze cruise where i hit my drink limit of    per day i never ever felt hungover once  i was amazed  i do this cruise twice a year and usually pay for it the first day but not with pre toxx    this    year old body felt like it was back in college again 
no more hangov,these are amazing  i use them anytime i am drinking and never have a hangover  i swear by these 
expected result,results so have been pretty favorable  i noticed that my grogginess in the morning was not as severe as i expected  i don t get many opportunities to try this product out  so i will need to continue using this before i can be certain it s not just a little placebo effect going on  but so far so good 
avid user since first try   ,i am a firm believer in this product  i have passed the info on to my friends and they are also addicted  nothing s better than waking up after a night of drinking and feeling fine  thank you so much for improving my weekends    
love it ,as i get older i find the hangovers seem to get worse  started taking this a few years ago and as long as you follow the directions  this makes a huge difference the next day  i do recommend taking the first dose with something in your stomach  if you re not used to taking a bunch of vitamins they can sometimes give you a slight feeling of nausea on an empty stomach  i keep a bottle on hand all the time 
buy these  well worth it ,this supplement is a game changer  if you think you re going to take these and wake up after a long night of drinking feeling like a million bucks you re kidding yourself  with that said  i ve noticed a significant improvement in my ability to  bounce back  the next morning  before these i would be debilitated all day after a long night  but when i take these as suggested i might feel a little groggy in the morning for a bit but then as the day progresses i forget i even had any alcohol the night before  try them out  well worth the cost 
it actually works   for me ,even one drink used to leave me with a hangover the next day  it wasn t worth it  now i can have a few drinks and pretoxx eliminates the issues tomorrow  i still need water and sleep  but with pretoxx i can actually sleep through the night instead of the alcohol waking me up at  am  i love this stuff 
this stuff really works ,ordered this for our upcoming all inclusive mexico trip  will be posting its effectiveness soon  update  this product really worked  we were at an all inclusive for   days and drank way more than we should have but never once felt hungover  took three pills before we started and three before bed  wow  it must be the nac levels in this  highly recommend 
best stuff ev,i used to never get hangovers ever  i could drink     shots and still be completely fine in the mornings  but last year my body decided to change things up and i got hangovers so easily  i could take   shots and be a little drunk  and the next day i would be so nauseous i couldn t do anything for an entire day  i stopped drinking for basically an entire year because i couldn t handle my hangovers  i bought these pills hoping they would help even a little bit in those rare occasions i would decide to drink  this stuff works  i can drink as much alcohol as i can take and will still feel great in the morning  i usually forget to take the pills prior to drinking and end up taking them while i m drunk and it still works like a charm  i recommend this to all my friends and always give it to them when it looks like they re going to have a rough morning       definitely will keep buying 
why waste your day ,purchased several times  follow the directions and you will be feeling much better than you should the day after 
did not work at al,been getting bad hangovers lately  after reading other reviews i had hope that it would alleviate hangovers  drank   ipas and took the pills as directed but still felt hungover the next day  didn t notice any difference  i also drank   drinks last night and have a terrible if not worse than usual hangover  these pills did nothing  not happy and want a refund 
this product works ,i couldn t believe how well this worked  i took the recommended dose before drinking and then took one pill every   or so beers  it does give you weird tasting burps  but totally worth it to not be hungover 
detoxx works great for me  even after making poor drinking decisions ,everyone is looking for that magic bullet to help them after a night out  i have tried a few supplements and found leslabs detoxx works great for me  even after making poor decisions at night  i wake up with a calm stomach  no headache and a full appetite  i m not getting any younger so the extra help is appreciated  i would recommend detoxx to anyone 
unreal ,this stuff is amazing  i take three before i drink  and three after the nights drinking session  the supplements have all the necessary b vitamins and minerals that prevent the build up of the many chemicals and biproducts of alcohol digestion  i ve never had a headache or nausea the next morning after a big drinking session  being a healthcare professional  i would like to remind you to still drink at least two glasses of water before you go to bed  you can t depend on the supplement by itself  dont forget that water 
helps a lot ,i think this actually helps some  i m very sensitive to alcohol and can wake up with a headache even if i only had     microbrews  this reduces those symptoms and nausea the next day 
works great,helped take the edge off the hangover  woke up with a much clearer mind and barely had a headache  definitely would recommend fo a night out
best thing ev,this is probably my  th bottle over the last few years  i can t live without it  i ve recommended it to everyone i know while out drinking  this is a life changer  it ends up taking away about        of my hangovers  depending on how much is drank the night before  i keep it in my purse  in the medicine cabinet  and in my overnight bag 
not drinking  but taking a load of pil,i am taking these to counteract the effects  if there are any  of other pills on my liver 
we ve noticed that we can no longer drink alcohol as much as we used to without getting terrible hangovers  no more are the all ,as my husband and i get older and cross into our thirties  we ve noticed that we can no longer drink alcohol as much as we used to without getting terrible hangovers  no more are the all night parties  we can barely share a bottle of wine without having a slight yet persisting headache the whole next day  with pretoxx  we still can t drop a case of beer in one night  but we can enjoy the bottle of wine  and maybe a few glasses more  without hesitation  if used correctly  this product actually helps reduce hangovers significantly  if not get rid of it all together  will buy again 
worked like a charm ,i was hesitant to try these but i was going on a cruise and had the drink package  hangovers are awful and it doesn t take much for me to get one  last one took me down for   days  so glad i tried these    took them everyday and always felt fine  i wish i would have tried them sooner 
good product,depending how much you drink  this product can either completely prevent a hangover or make the hangover bearable and that s all you can really ask for  have   beers in a night  you ll feel great  have a whole liter of vodka  if you re still alive  you won t be in complete misery the next day and your liver will thank you 
this supplement work,i love the taste of wine with food  but it doesn t love me  this supplement mitigates the side effects and helps me feel better the next day  without fail 
a staple for carnival season ,omg  this stuff makes you feel better than you have any right to the day after drinking  if you can get it together to take as directed it works amazing  if you only remember to take it in the    minutes before you collapse into bed  it still works pretty well 
i can function better the next day ,these pills definitely help my next day better  i usually get terrible hangovers by throwing up alot but these help me less sick  when i was introducing these to my friends  one of the friend already had taken these and said these help his hangover alot too  this product definitely makes the hangover more bearable 
did not work   still got terrible hangov,i have tried     hangover relief products and this is yet another one to really offer me no help  i followed instructions and didn t even drink too much but still had routine hangovers 
works for m,been using for a few days definitely helps for the next morning   will buy again  
must hav,i highly recommend this product  i am a mother of two little ones and sometimes   glasses of wine can ruin the next day completely  i started taking detoxx for hangovers about   months ago  i take   before i know i am going to have a glass or two of wine  and   before bed that night  the pills work great 
didn t have any hangovers on my cruis,these seemed to help a lot on my cruise  drinking all day isn t a normal event for me  i took these and volt by tonilq a few times a day  no hangovers  no headaches  energized all day to maximize my fun 
highly recommend ,i bought this product so i wouldn t end up sidelined after one day on a cruise with my girlfriends  i tried it out last night at a party and it did everything it said it would  i was even able to get my scheduled long run in     miles  without feeling the effects of the night before  highly recommend 
herbal remedi,i use this herbal treatment before a night out and it s been very effective 
i don t feel like i over indulged too much but i do feel they,i bought these because i am prone to alcohol induced migraines  although it didn t help with the migraine at all  i did not feel the stomach turning effects of alcohol  granted  i don t feel like i over indulged too much but i do feel they help
don t party without  em ,these pills do wonders  i ve been using them for about   months now and am on my third bottle  i only pull them out for special occasions  when i know there will be extra imbibing  i have tried various hangover remedies over the years  and this formula seems to be the best  the only problem that comes in occasionally is that you may begin drinking without remembering to take them  my friends have also appreciated that i share these with them  and have thanked me  i love how one reviewer broke down the content and the price  pointing out that you could buy the ingredients separately  i do think these are a tad on the pricey side  but you can t beat the convenience  it s totally worth it  and i highly recommend 
really helps ,i have used other  drinking pills  before  but this seem to be particularly effective  especially if i take the dose before and after as well  even if it s just after  i can definitely tell the difference between taking it and not  i wish it came in travel sizes  so i can put them in my purse when i head out and always have it on me  would a happy hour strike unexpectedly   
reunion  wedding  vacation  this is for you   ,great supplement for those occasional times you might indulge a few glasses too many  also with all the toxins in food and the environment use as a daily supplement to support liver health 
i take one every day to help support my liver    ,i take one every day to help support my liver  i notice that i don t feel as groggy or exhausted after a night of drinking  i give my bf some periodically too and it helps him a lot since his hangovers are usually a killer 
great hangover help,i can t recover like i used to  and hate feeling out of sorts the next day  so i m always looking for ways to still enjoy a few extra drinks or a late night out without feeling terrible  these pretoxx pills are perfect  i take a few of these before drinking  then i find the hangovers anywhere from minimal to non existent  i also like their use of natural ingredients  i ve tried a few other products before  and i think pretoxx is the best of the bunch 
my favorite hangover pil,i ve tried four different hangover pills and while they all work  i think this one works the best and is my favorite 
works well and helps with hangov,very good product that works well  i find that i sleep better and ultimately helps me have less of a hangov
great product that works ,this stuff actually does help a lot  i ve tried so many different things over the years and will definitely have to say this works the best  
good clean product,awesome customer service and really good product   super quick in helping with the recovery phase of a night that you went  too hard  
these let me survive thailand ,i just got back from a trip to thailand and did a ridiculous amount of drinking  thanks to these miracle pills and a couple tylenol before bed  i never got a hangover that prevented me from doing any of the day activities 
i like it,ordered pretoxx because ru   went out of business  need to try it a few more times to see if it performs as well as ru   
they work ,great replacement for the now gone hangoverx product
seems good to me ,i don t think this will completely erase any thought that you might have over consumed some adult beverages the night before  but it definitely helps  i ll keep using it 
these seriously work  got through burning man without a single hangover ,brought these to burning man  not one hangover the whole ten days  i get bad hangovers that last a whole day every time i drink  these pills are a lifesaver 
worked for m,did not feel as bad the day after a night out drink
i think it work,i  think  this helps with hangovers  of course it s not a magical solution but i feel slightly better the next day 
these pills are life changing  i can t drink a    ,these pills are life changing  i can t drink a glass of wine without a headache or nausea but on these i was able to rally and drink bottles for days in a row 
best hangover prevention measure i ve tried   ,great product  i take   every morning  and as directed when i drink  i ve never had a problem functioning the next morning after a night of heavy drinking thanks to pretox  i ve tried those patches and they just don t work the same  if you can keep them from falling off 
sure seems to help,seems to assist when you don t go too wild with the drinking  i did however still get a few hangovers after a large quantity of drinks as to be expected  that said  it has some vitamins and such that are good for your liver and overall health 
definitely makes a noticeable differ,i went to a four day music convention and knew i would likely drink maybe a few too many on a night or two  i thought these might help to mitigate the morning after and they did just that  three pills with the first drink and another three before i went to bed  will definitely be using these at any festivals or conventions in the future 
worthless,i ve had the pills for a couple of months now  and not one single time i ve used them have they helped 
will keep on buying as long as i keep drinking ,obviously i purchased these pills because i just can t bounce back from a night of partying like i used to  i m    and ever since i passed     i feel like hell the next day  no appetite  anxious  headaches  overall feeling of nausea  just the worst  i saw that drinkwel raised their prices so i decided to give these a try  i took them to a family cabin trip to tahoe and my family parties pretty hard  i woke up everyday feeling fine and the mimosas also probably helped  if you don t like wasting your whole sunday feeling like death  give these a try  you won t feel completely      more like     but that s still doable  i recommend you drink lots of water before bed and when you wake up  it s also most effective with enough sleep 
there worth the money,they work really good my fiance and i use them  you can feel it in your kidneys after taking them  they do help with the hang ov
three star,not sure how it is working  but i tried     
don t get your hopes up,i fell a sucker to to the reviews  this product no means makes you wake up       much better off drinking water before you go to b
it works ,my boyfriend took this and really wanted to test it out  so he drank a lot of whiskey and beer  he said his hangover symptoms the next day were very managable and that the stuff really works  he also drank on an empty stomach and didnt have much water  so i m sure that if you did those things  you would be even better off     another test run coming up soon 
works great,really helped alleviate some of the hangover symptoms  used it several times so far and it s helped every time  it does have a funny after taste and made my pee smell weird but nothing too bad 
after both times using this product  plus some morning emergen c for good measure   my hangovers were virtually non exist,i used this product recently at   events where i knew heavy drinking would be involved    have to say  now in my mid   s  my hangovers can be brutal  after both times using this product  plus some morning emergen c for good measure   my hangovers were virtually non existent  always important to hydrate    but i am convinced these are little  miracle pills  
these really work    ,these actually work it s amazing   only have a slight head ache when normally i d be bed ridden for days after a night out  definitely recommend to anyone who gets bad hangovers 
excellent pedialyte substitut,tired if having to chug a gallon of pedialyte  well look no further because these things work  took them on a trip to vegas and didn t get a single hangover  i was skeptical of an item like this but they definitely are effective at reducing the negative effect of drinking        would not be a degenerate without them 
this product is legit ,i was one of the skeptical people thinking how can a pill cure a hangover  well  my hangovers were so bad that i had no other choice and to stop drinking was out of the question lol  i drink   pills when i start drinking and   pills before bed along with lots of water    beers   half the time i wake up like a champ the other half i might have a slight headache but nothing aspirin won t cure  it s better than being in bed feeling like crap all day promising yourself you re never gunna drink again  when i do have the slight headache there is no nausea feeling when i take this product so i m able to eat and recover faster 
i still felt bad after a night of drinking and taking this suppl,i suppose it does what its supposed to do  i just don t think there is a hangover supplement out there that will work for me  i still felt bad after a night of drinking and taking this supplement  maybe i need to take more 
i recently went on a trip to greece for a    ,i recently went on a trip to greece for a wedding and this was my wingman  this really works on helping you deal with over indulgence  i would take this before drinking and before going to bed  the heat combined with alcohol can be trying  but this helped me hang in there and to be able to participate in all of the wedding activities  definitely worth the buy 
i m in my late   s and my hangovers have gotten increasingly worse  as long as i take a couple of    ,i really think this stuff works  i m in my late   s and my hangovers have gotten increasingly worse  as long as i take a couple of pretoxxes before drinking  drink some water  and be sure to eat a good dinner  my hangovers are much improved  i still have fogginess but no nausea or headache  i m sold 
your morning self with thank your evening self ,typically  evening guy gets to have all of the fun  at the expense of morning guy  i m a skeptic and a guy who typically screws over his morning self by staying up late and having a good time  i was also skeptical of pretoxx  but decided to give it a try based on the reviews  i am delighted to say that it seems to work well  i ll continue to eat a pill or two when i m drinking   from now on 
fake reviews   ,looking forward to trying this for my upcoming trip to vegas   will report back  update  this product didn t do anything and most   if not all   of these reviews have to be fake  they offered me free products in exchange for reviews on this and other products the company makes  so i assume that s how they have gotten so many   star reviews 
it works ,i wasn t sure how it would go at first but this supplement actually works  i have a very low alcohol tolerance and always get hangovers  i haven t had so much as a headache with pretoxx  the only thing it doesn t do is help me sleep after i ve had a few drinks  for some reason alcohol keeps me up at night 
real help,real helps if you control yourself not to be too drunk
it works   sort of,i bought these not knowing if they would work  i was very skeptical  i decided to try them out last night after some heavy drinking  i took   pills about    minutes before drinking and i woke up this morning with a hangover but not as intense of one that i am used to  maybe i should have taken four instead  i don t no  but i doubt i will buy more in the future 
wow,pills really work  i get bad hangovers and this lets me wake up and atleast be able to function 
this stuff works  it won t help if you get    ,this stuff works  it won t help if you get completely plastered but it definitely makes a difference if you re trying to avoid a headache the next day from a couple glasses of wine  even if you forget to take the pills before drinking  they still help if you take a couple at the end of the night 
i like this product,i like this product  seems to help on those nights where you know you might be drinking more then you should  helps alleviate hangovers and through research  i believe that it helps the liver reboot your system  i think that this lessens the blow from a night of binge drink
works well ,i suffer badly from hangovers and this really helped  no headache and no nausea when i put these pills to the test  just the usual foggy tired feeling 
works well  very happy ,these work amazingly well 
it actually works    ,works great  just make sure you read the instructions and eat before taking them since they are essentially a vitamin supplement  i take this and drink pedialyte before bed after a big night  best anti hangover i ve ever bought  and i ve tried quite a few
great recovery aid   keeps you hydrated   ,this combination of herbs does aid in keeping you well hydrated if you decide to imbibe just a little more then you expect to  it won t completely keep you hangover free  but will aid in the recovery time the following day  make sure to continue to hydrating  really helps the following day 
it works great  would recommend,i m not    anymore and one glass of wine affects me the next day  for the times i want a couple though  this stuff works  won t curb a hangover after doing fireball and rumple minze shots all night  trust me on this one  but hey  if you re in your forties doing shots  you deserve a hangover  for reasonable drinking  it works great  would recommend 
perfect product,if you prepare and take these before you drink  there will be     less headache in the morning 
work,seems to work as described  i ve tried a couple products like this and this one definitely takes the edge of the next day 
great product  a must have ,if you re having more than a couple drinks this is a must have  seems to neutralize the ill effects of any toxins your body produce s from overindulgence  you may still feel a bit sluggish the next day if you really tied on on  but for what i consider moderate over consumption  it does the job   
absolutely does not work,i used it multiple times  following the exact directions and it flat out does not work 
highly recommend ,this stuff really works  have tried everything but this actually helps and my friends agree  highly recommend 
it doesn t work,these definitely don t work for hangovers it doesn t help at all don t waste your money on thi
contains a great mix of vitamins and miner,great mix of vitamins and minerals  it has milk thistle for liver support  i m not a heavy drinker  but this helps on those nights where i don t want to worry about waking up drained from drinking the night before 
seriously helps to lessen your hangover   ,this pill is a lifesaver  well hangover saver  the older i ve gotten  in my early    s now   the worse my hangovers are and it really sucks  this pill really cuts my hangover in half the next day  i m able to be productive the next day and not hug the toilet anymore  thank goodness 
    the edge away but it is no miracle capsule like i was hoping for,may have possibly took a little of the edge away but it is no miracle capsule like i was hoping for  will not buy again 
surprisingly good  one bottle got me through a very boozy    ,surprisingly good  one bottle got me through a very boozy christmas  i felt fine every morning only a little tired  the first time i didn t use this supplement was on nye and boy did i pay for it the following day  i ordered a new batch while face down in bed suffering my first hangover in several weeks 
this product is a must    ,this product is a must if you re going to drink and still need to function the next day  if used properly  i don t feel like i ve indulged at all the next day  i find it works best if i take a couple right before drinking  then a couple more after a few drinks  then a couple more with plenty of water right before bed  going on a cruise this spring  and i ll be bringing plenty of pretoxx along with us 
four star,used these this past weekend and noticed slight difference the next morn
it works ,so rare to find a product that truly lives up to its claims   but this does    used to wake up with headache over night and then pay for a night of fun into the next day  but this really  truly prevents that  love it    
great for a supplement ,use it as a supplement and i feel great  all your vitamins in on
waste of money, st time used took what was recommended did not work   nd time doubled everything still did not work  waste of money 
detoxx,really work
for all my fellow heavy sociak drinkers  this works ,i absolutely love this product  i drank heavily for   straight days in cancun and i never once felt hungover  i m in my late    s so hangovers are rough nowadays  but this is now my go to  i did still need some motrin in the morning for a headache but once that passed i was      
good,good
waste of money,does not work at all  had multiple people try them and did nothing 
they won t just be smart how you use them,em they do there job what the product says only thing is you need to take like   of them not at one time  like before you start drinking and   to end your night of drinking then waking up take   more then your good to go
keel coming back to it   ,i ve tried two other hangover formulas and this is by far the most effective  i don t drink that often  but i do have the occasional heavy nights when these coming in handy  i m in healthcare and definitely care about my body  i do   before the night begins and another   before i sleep with a ton of water and when i wake up  i m totally good  great product 
does not work,i was really hoping these would work even if it was a placebo affect from the positive reviews    i ve honestly never been as hungover as i was the day after taking these as directed  i would not try these for the first time during a weekend you don t want to miss out on 
works great for me  but ymmv,been using this for a couple bottles now and it works great for me  like other reviews  i ve tried drinking lightly  moderately and heavy and varied the amount of pills taken each time  if i drink lightly  i really don t need to take a pretoxx but one pill will take care of any hangover effect the next day  if i drink moderately  then one may or may not work  but two pills definitely works  if i drink heavily  then two pills is a must  i ve tried taking just one and then drinking heavily and i was still hungover the next day  two pills or more definitely works for me however  and i weigh only     pounds  it really helps with head aches  body aches  and overall feeling like crap the next day  what sets pretoxx apart from the other hangover pills is that you can take it before or after you drink  and i ve tried doing both and it is effective both ways for me  it s just easier taking two of them before going out to drink and not worry about having to remember to take them when you get home  i ve forgotten many times to take it when i get home  so taking it before drinking is so much easier  if you are coherent enough to remember to take two pills before going to sleep after drinking heavily then you probably don t need to take them 
real deal,very good product  working great so far definitely feel difference  justnpurchased second bottle 
like it so much i subscribed    lol,really love this stuff  whenever i take it i can feel a noticeable difference the next day with a hang over  i like it more than party smart because you have the flexibility to take between     depending on how much you drink where as party smart you just take one capsule each time  helps save some money if you are taking it easy and don t drink as much one night and you can take   if you drink a solid amount 
woke up early feeling like i didn t even drink,i was very skeptical about this but tried it last night for a trip to a brewery  i can t believe it but it worked    before drinking  took it about half an hour before   then   more before i went to bed  woke up early feeling like i didn t even drink  i m really going to test it out new years eve but feel better about it knowing this actually works 
great product   does what it says  focus on supplementing ,works very well when following directions  outside of the usual tiredness and slight fatigue you get after tipping a few too many  you feel really good and ready to take on the day  i m looking at one per day as a dietary supplement as well  you should try this  a couple of months supplementing with this product  once per day  and i feel great   lots of energy 
not just for drinking binges ,i really liked this product  i purchased it in anticipation of a few fun nights in vegas  it seemed to do the trick  the best thing is you can continue to take it for everyday liver support as well  no alcohol intake necessary   
actually seems to work ,i ve used it a couple times now and actually seems to work  now to try it out in vegas   
i m going to keep a look out for something better ,hard to tell if this makes a huge difference or not  i still get shocking headaches after drinking even with taking these and drinking tonnes of water before bed  i wish it had been a cure all  not so in my case  i m sure all the vitamins are helping  i m going to keep a look out for something better 
i believe it work,nothing with supplements will give you crystal clear night and day results  that said  i truly believe these help significantly  i went on a   night golf trip where drinking was central to the long weekend  at     i was skeptical at how well i would hold up  i was way fresher in the morning than i ever recall  i was sold 
work better than other typ,i ve tried a few types of hangover cures and these seem to work best  a moderate amount 
no more sluggish after wineries ,my husband and i are very pleased with this great product  we use it for events like weddings  vacations  and special wine occasions and feel perfectly fine the next day 
its nice to be able to have a little fun and    ,seems to actually work    its nice to be able to have a little fun and still wake up early and feel good 
it works   ,i dont over imbibe often but when i do i use this product  it helps me to feel good the next day  works like a charm 
best cure for hangovers by far ,dollar for dollar this is the best preventative measure for hangovers beyond not drinking  which no one wants to do   i ve purchased four  fiveish  bottles of pretoxx now and cannot recommmend it enough  the only advice i give is take the pills about an hour before you start drinking  note this is all you have to take for the night which is much better than taking   chasers every two hours  and drink a decent amount of water before passing out for the night  granted if you re heavily drinking you re not going to wake up feeling great  but you will wake up functional enough to go to work  i can say this from experience i work the morning shift   at under     a bottle this more than pays for itself considering sick days cost more  and who really wants to take a sick day when they re actually sick   great for vacations as well  because also who wants to lose a vacation day 
work,work
perfect all around product that gets the job done ,a friend of ours recommended this over the typical liquid alternatives  this seems to work so much better  b vitamins for replenish energy  magnesium which helps me sleep after through the night  will make this our normal mainstay 
pleasantly surpris,doesn t completely eliminate my hangovers  but gets rid of the major symptoms  nausea  headache   good product 
these work ,tried  x so far  these work great  i was able to skip headache nausea all together  i still felt a little  blah  but if i had things to do    could have done them 
it works most of the time ,it seems like some nights it works great but some nights don t  it s worth it i guess   
it s worth trying   ,first off it does work  and i am a very skeptical person   and when used as directed it works very well  here are a few key points i ve discovered  so far i have tried this product about    times      they don t work the same on everybody  i think people that get depleted bad of vitamin b complex when drinking will have the greatest benefit  but not everyone is the same  i personally think hangovers have different causes for everyone  it worked great for me  but my other friends said it worked  good  or  ok  but not  amazing   if all the other test subjects i ve given this product too however  nobody reported this as  bogus  and all said they would rather have it than not  if you already have a strong b complex diet you might not see much benefit  however it s rare for americans to have a strong b complex diet so you should see some benefit     i don t have the headache or anxiety from a hangover when using this  but i do feel tired  just as you would with a hangover  and i do have  rotgut   however for me that s a great tradeoff  i got really bad headaches and the anxiety depression drove me crazy     it has a  tolerance  too  the first time i took this i got the best results  the first time i took this i felt like i cheated death and was invincible  the times after have still been good  but not like the first time  it does not seem to work consecutively either  if you re going to drink friday and saturday night  don t expect to be invincible the whole weekend  in those situations  i will take it friday and just go easy on saturday     it does have a disgusting taste  but who cares 
when you know you want to make bad decisions  ,i never used to get hangovers  but as i ve gotten older all it takes is the wrong combination of alcohol or that one drink too many and i m useless the next day    i ve used the product  chaser  before  and that seemed to work okay  but i feel more comfortable with the ingredients in pretoxx  and it s every bit as effective   as with any other hangover prevention product  it s a good idea for you to take a few steps to ensure it s effectiveness  like      having a glass of milk or eating a somewhat greasy meal    minutes or more prior to drinking  both milk and vegetable oil grease coat the stomach lining and slow the absorption of alcohol       drinking water periodically throughout the night  and especially before going to bed  and     avoiding too many drinks with a high sugar content  ladies  this is mostly targeted at us  put down the smirnoff ice and enjoy a nice vodka tonic instead   it s for the best   happy adult beverage drinking 
five star,love this product   i always have bad hangovers and the product has eliminated them  party like a rock star   
i have to say these do work pretty darn wel,i have to say these do work pretty darn well  won t help if you binge drink all day  but a good night of partying and these will have you waking up feeling better than normal 
amazing stuff ,use this  haven t had a hangover in   years   amazing stuff
enjoy your alcoholic beverage today and feel good tomorrow ,i like to drink dry red wine every afternoon and evening  i can take detoxx for hangovers   liver support while enjoying my wine and i know i ll sleep good and wake up feeling great  no hangover  thank you detoxx 
doesn t work ,still got a makor hangover and i didn t even drink that much 
i haven t been using pretoxx that long but i have    ,i haven t been using pretoxx that long but i have noticed a definite decrease in headaches and nausea  i m a smaller frame woman and usually take two pills before drinking and  maybe  one or two before bed  nothing beats a proper nights sleep  but this really helps especially if you must work the day aft
one star,terrible  it s not even eligible for return  terrible side effects  still had hangover 
great product,really helps for when you have some extra drink
seems to work for m,i have used this mainly when i go on vacation to the islands and have a desire for cold beer when on the beach  i take two before i start on the beer and i believe it really helps me feel better the next day  i guess it depends one each individual but itwould not hurt to try one bottle and give it a try  sure beats a hangover the next morning 
works great  but never received coupon code last two orders ,works great  but never received coupon code last two orders 
these really work,these really work  very pleased with the product and will be ordering more  i take   at start of a party  wedding or big celebration and then   more at end of night bedtime and wake up fine  no hangover    
worked as expect,good product  does exactly what it is supposed to when taken as directed   when i take it before and after drinking the amount of alcohol that would normally leave me feeling ill  i feel fine and am able to be functional the next day  will purchase again 
next morning had one of the worst hangovers i ve ever had,i was very excited about this product  took   pills before going out and   pills when i got home  next morning had one of the worst hangovers i ve ever had     
do not waste your money ,these do not work at all do not even waste your money    i had maybe   or   beers last night and i feel maybe worse than if i had not taken these  my head is pounding and i feel like i could vomit at any second  thanks for nothing    i did take these as directed too 
not a miracle worker   ,meh  didn t notice anything and you need to take a lot of capsules 
this stuff is amazing  tried and true for a girls weekend,this stuff is amazing  tried and true for a girls weekend  we went on a wine tour    drank all day long  no hangover   i always get hangovers where i puke in the am  also went out   drank a margarita  shot of tequila   probably   beers  no hangover   i even forgot to take the second   before bed  amazing 
works ,this is a product that i will definitely reorder  took as directed  do remember to take the last   before bed  i did  my husband didn t  we had a night working at a beer garden and enjoyed our time there to say the least  we both took first dose  i was the only one to take second  next day husband not functioning well  i was perfectly fine  works for me 
feel,made me feel extremely tired and groggy the next day  i tried   times 
it works ,i used to use another product that s now out of stock  this was amazons choice  so i decided to give it a shot  it actually works pretty well  better if you take it before and after  i don t experience any negative side effects and it definitely takes the bite out of or prevents hangovers altogether  i would definitely recommend this product 
life savers    ,these pills work great  i pop   at the end of the night after drinking  no hangover the next day  i may feel a bit tired the following day but definitely no head ache  i m on my second bottle     capsules get you a long way for the price 
effective ,if you take as directed plus a little more before bed depending on your size how much you ve had to drink it definitely reduces hangover effects  make sure to drink water though 
the price is great  and my hangovers seemed a little better then    ,the price is great  and my hangovers seemed a little better then normal  however compared to other products this particular brand has a very pungent smell and taste  the taste caused a few of my friends to spit the pill out  i personally was able to take them without any issu
shockingly effect,the stuff smells like bottled fart  but boy does it seem to work  granted  i paired this with lyteshow so i can t really tell which was more effective  either way  i survived the bachelor party to vegas and recovered pretty quickly 
did not work for m,not sure on others but this did not work for m
but my friends love it ,i haven t had the chance to try it yet  but my friends love it 
amazing ,unfortunately hangovers for me happen even after only a few drinks  it made them nonexistent with mellow nights and with the special events where i went a bit overboard  very impressed and will be ordering more 
friend puk,did not work at all  friend and i both drank to where we re normally slightly hungover  just to test out before a festival weekend  my friend ended up puking both that night and in the morning  i felt worse than normal  but did not throw up  would not recommend 
prevents headaches ,as i ve gotten older  i can get a headache after just a couple of glasses of wine or a few beers  since i ve started using this product i have not had any headaches or had that  yucky  feeling the next morning  so nice to be able to enjoy a couple of glasses of good wine with dinner again and not worry about how i will feel the next morning 
really helps with hangov,i m a terrible lightweight   i can get a hangover from   glasses of wine  the milk thistle and such in this supplement really helps  whatever combination they have really works  i take   when i m done drinking and three the next morning and i feel much better  a bit expensive but worth it to enjoy my wine 
no ,rip off 
great product                ,i got this product in the mail a week ago used it twice already it really does work wonders  i take   before i drink and   after i get done drinking for the night and the next day no nausia  no headache or body aches    only thing that isnt diffrent is i feel tired wich isnt that big of a deal cause caffinee can fix that    other than that amazing product i think everyone should try pretoxx if you have pretty bad hangovers from a fun night out
very good pretoxx,pretoxx is really good bottle  you need to follow the instruction  it work for me every time i drink  i will continue to purchase the item when i ne
will update review after i ve used it for awhil,this appears to be a very good product at a good price  but i will update my review once i have used it for a while longer 
they work ,well i decided to try these due to the positive reviews and they work  i felt much better than usual the following day 
little pricey,i m pretty sure this helped with my following day  icannot be certain though  i d like to keep trying it but it s a little pricey    before   after  bottle of    goes quickly 
it works but it is no miracle ,for you to be browsing hangover pills on amazon  you must get some grave hangovers  i sure do  i used to drink all night and suffer from only dry mouth the next day  then  in my early twenties  i started getting all day hangovers  and now at my mid twenties  i get three day hangovers that leave me lifeless  sick  depressed  nauseated and make me eat all day  i turn into a bottomless pit and eat everything in sight   and on and on  the hangover i get from two drinks is the same from     it s horrendous  i ve tried vitamin water  chugging   bottles of water before bed  vitamins  eating food before and after  everything   nothing works but this has helped slightly  so  here are some experiences     one night i took   pretoxx with water before going out for two big glasses of wine and dinner  took three again after  slept at a reasonable hour and had a bottle of water before bed  i had zero hangover and felt fine  so far  this is a godsend     i went to dinner again but i could not find the pretoxx  i took two regular milk thistle pills and went out and had two glasses of wine  the next morning i had a mild to moderate hangover but it went away by      p m        i went out again to a theme park and had three strong vodka cocktails  i took   pretoxx before and after  i ended up walking the whole night and drank plenty of water  went to bed before      a m  no hangover     last night  i drank plenty of water and had friends over in which i drank about   glasses of wine and   vodka waters  i took pretoxx before and after  i woke up today was no headache  no nausea  no guilt anxiety  but i was supppppppper fatigued  i was in bed until      p m  before i could get up and be a functioning human  i would say pretoxx is not a cure all  but it will probably reduce your hangover in half  if you re someone who just gets miserable hangovers  then take pretoxx so you re not dead after you drink 
two star,honestly    aspirins and a bottle of water do exactly the same 
noticeably help,great product  if used correctly  you should see a notable difference  however  sometimes after a few drinks  i have forgotten to take the post drinking dosage  when that has happened  i ve noticed some hangover symptoms the next day  but not as severe as they would have been  so even a half dosage is helpful  when drinking excessively      cocktails   i have still been sluggish the next day  but i don t have headaches  which is what hits me hardest in my hangovers  
recovered quick,pretty legit  i ve used it a few times while on a river trip and recovered like i was in my    s again 
i use it for liver health  as i m not    ,i use it for liver health  as i m not a drinker friends made it all the way through the four days of partying without petering out by the last day   but i was the hero when i took it on a group camping trip  its the first time ii can remember that my drunkest friends made it thru the week without petering out by the end 
i found that taking   before you drink and   at the end of the night with a bottle of water works best  i will buy,def reduces ur hangover  i found that taking   before you drink and   at the end of the night with a bottle of water works best  i will buy mor
they help ,brought this with me for a weekend camping trip in the poconos  drunk me still remembered to take these as prescribed and it definitely lessened the hangover the next day  little wobbly and stomach was a little touchy  but made it through an entire weekend of paintball thanks to these nifty pills      
so far so good ,so far so good  i did what another has suggested    i just take   every   drinks rather than   before and   after  you re not perfect the next day  but you re not sick nor dying of a headache 
    am already quite a light weight    they worked fine the first tim,i purchased these to use on a trip to the mountains  i was afraid the altitude would affect me a lot as i am already quite a light weight    they worked fine the first time  but the second time i had heartburn for almost   days  and so did my friend who took them with me     
this isn t eligible for a return and it s awful ,headache inducer  not prevent
waste of money,didn t make any difference for me  took as directed  and did t put a dent in my hangover  waste of money 
doesn t seem to work all that well   ,i have taken a bunch of different types of hangover cure capsules  drinks  etc  this one is no different  swears that it works but i wake up the next morning with a horrible headache and nausea  even after a full night s rest and plenty of water before bed 
worth a tri,i feel like it does provide some hangover relief but it isn t any foolproof cure  i have friends that claim it really is fantastic for them  it probably depends on your body chemistry 
definitely has made my day after drinking a lot easier    ,definitely has made my day after drinking a lot easier  i would just take   before i start drinking and then by the end of the night if i remember  i take one  i also take one as soon as i wake up and i was able to actually get out of bed and be productive 
five star,actually does help  there s no cure  but as a precautionary measure  it does help 
worthwhile buy ,this product works  historically my hangovers have been worse than anyone i know  i have tried many products throughout the years  never expecting a miracle pill  but just searching to find something to prevent me from being incapacitated the day after drinking  you will still get hungover but it will be drastically improved 
will defintely recommend to oth,bought these for our week at an all inclusive in riviera maya  i was surprised how well these worked  of the   of us  i was the only one that took these  at no point of the week did i ever have the hangover symptoms that the rest of the group did despite enjoying the  all inclusive ness as much as everyone else  will defintely recommend to oth
gives you the jitt,this gave my husband and i both an extreme case of the jitters  tried to return but is not eligible for return  reached out to seller and amazon with no response 
effect,definitely helps  i don t drink as much as i used to but now pushing    it takes less to feel just as worse the next day  so while i can t vouch for a heavy night out i can absolutely say your better off with this than without 
this supplement actually works ,i ve used this a few times now and it really does seem to help prevent me from feeling hungover in the morning  i m a musician and often find myself staying up waay too late after shows having drinks with friends and socializing  i wanted something to help prevent hangovers since i need to be productive in the morning  now i take   capsules before i perform if i know i ll have a few late night drinks with friends and i feel fine in the morning   
product makes a difference ,as i ve gotten older i have found that i don t tolerate alcohol like i did in my younger days  after searching many hangover relievers  pretoxx seems to work the best  three pills before drinking  a lot  and three pills before bed helped a great deal  i didn t experience the headache and nausea that i often wake up with  i believe the prickly pear was what might have made a difference from the other supplements that i ve tried  i will continue to take pretoxx 
works pretty good   ,this product works pretty good  i don t usually fill out reviews  but i m going to get a free bottle for doing this  anyway  if you get totally hammered  it s probably not going to make a huge difference  but if you get drunk and follow the directions  this product will help some  try it for yourself 
great product,took before and after as instructed  no hangover the next day  felt great 
try it ,excellent product for the body even if you don t drink  give it a try you will notice a difference 
and our work schedule is pretty tough too   we have to be at work    ,this stuff works because it contains ingredients needed to balance your body after major celebrating  my friends and i are not  amateurs  in the drinking realm  and our work schedule is pretty tough too   we have to be at work at      which means we are out of bed by       this is not so easy after a sunday funday that started at      brunch and didn t finish until early evening leaving a wake of empty champagne bottles  wine bottles  and margarita glasses  the following mondays are completely horrible  and if you re reading this you know what i m talking about   you re dizzy  nauseated  and still taste alcohol  you know you need to hydrate and eat but you feel sooooo crappy that the thought of eating anything makes you dry heave  and then there are the times that even drinking an electrolyte beverage comes right back up  am i right    yup  so   i figured i would experiment  and yes  i ve done the  drink a bunch of water and take gobs of advil  but that doesn t really work for me  i ve got one friend that doing the water advil is all she needs  not me  but it may be because i m not a big water drinker  anyway  i tried the pretoxx as directed     pills w a glass of water before i started drinking  then   more when i came home  i ve done this a couple of times just to make sure i wasn t fooling myself  and it works  seriously 
worth a shot ,not sure if this is a placebo effect or not  but i bought a bottle of this stuff for my bachelor party  we went hard that weekend  with     hours a day of drinking  all the guys took this stuff and we were all surprised with the lack of hangover the next day  definitely worth a try 
great for overall liver protection and recoveri,overall really good product not only for detox and recovery but also good for liver health and promoting healthy liver function  i will certainly continue to use the product and will be adding it to my vitamin plan 
continuous customer ,i have ordered two bottles now and about to order my third  i always have to have these on hand  they definitely make life a lot less miserable after a night of drinking 
it saved me from those tremendous headache hangovers  still    ,it saved me from those tremendous headache hangovers  still foggy  but no headaches which is a lot more manageable if not taken at all 
five star,these work wonders  no more hangovers at all 
helps with migrain,i generally get migraines when i drink alcohol  i tried taking detoxx before and after drinking and i ve been able to reduce the number of migraines i get after drinking  i d definitely recommend this to others 
i fond this product to be beneficial at combating hangover    ,i fond this product to be beneficial at combating hangover symptoms after a night of drinking with friends  i m not a heavy drinker  but after taking these before hand i was able to function well the following day  i will keep using this product when needed 
exactly as shown,exactly as shown
works as advertised ,works as advertised  the important thing is to remember to take it before hand  not really a hassle just an extra step  i don t think it s necessary to take one daily as recommended because i feel like you will burn through all    in no time 
previously used barmate and that worked ok for the first    ,previously used barmate and that worked ok for the first couple of times but then just didn t work there after  so far  this has worked every time  doesn t help for the lack of sleep that accompanies drinking too much but no headache  no nausea  will buy again 
i took them with a meal about     hours before i started drinking and i woke up feeling great  still tired but no other hangov,really seemed to help me a lot with my hangovers  i took them with a meal about     hours before i started drinking and i woke up feeling great  still tired but no other hangover symptoms  would absolutely recommend this product 
like to drink,ok  so this is what s up  like to drink  don t like the hangovers  like any of us  duh  heard about the  hangover pills  from a friend  figured i d give those a shot  you re supposed to take   of them before drinking and three before going to bed with a glass of water   usually i d forget to take the first three  but always take three before going to sleep  first time i had done taken these little things  the morning after was actually great  no headache  no heaviness  no nothing  if anything i felt better than most mornings in general  i think this product works  however nothing is a panacea  so still be reasonable with your drinking habits  best of luck 
good hangover support,i found this helps you feel better the next day  and taking one in the morning works too 
works for me ,i m not a real heavy drinker  any more  because my body can t handle alcohol  even in moderate doses  three or more beers   your product allows me to drink moderately with no crappy feeling the next day 
definitely helps with hangov,if you drink heavy don t expect it to be a cure all but these defiantly help  take   before drinking and remember to take   more before bed  the taste isn t great but the results are definitely worth it 
won t go out for the night without them ,absolutely unbelievable  i normally get horrible hangovers  but wake up feeling great after taking these before drinking  also take them afterwards if it was a long day night of partying     if i didn t try them myself   i never would have believed they would be as effective as they are 
effective  but a lot of pills to swallow ,used an entire bottle over the holidays and they definitly help  the only issue is the quaintly they reccommend taking is   before drinking and   before bed  this only last    days  fewer pills with the same result would be better 
it actually works ,this stuff actually works  i get hangover symptoms from just     drinks and this eliminates them completely  pretty unreal 
detox,so far good no hangover the next day
won t drink without it ,this stuff really works  take   capsules before drinking and   after before you go to bed and i don t notice any of the negative side effects from the nights i would go out drinking  used to feel like my body was so depleted the next day  but with this supplements it no longer feels that way
good product ,good products tested by myself and friends of mine with all positive feedback  i actually use less that suggested  sometimes only   before instead of the   after drinking also  it is hard to remember to take pills when you get home after drinking often  my studies showed  lol
makes a noticeable  significant difference ,i ve experimented with a variety of liver support formulas  this has a potent variety of effective ingredients  substantially more than a placebo with a mere glass of water before and after drinking would do  i made it through a four day wedding  with musicians no less   with no appreciable hangover 
solid product,i ve only been using it for a week or so  but seems to take the edge off of hangovers  what used to be an all day hangover is now gone by mid afternoon  it doesn t totally eliminate the systems  but makes them more bearable and seems to speed up the recovery 
i think these are helpful  it very well may    ,i think these are helpful  it very well may be that by taking these i am more mindful of trying to prevent a hangover and therefore drink more water  but nonetheless  they seem to work 
highly recommended ,very impressed  i ve been suffering from headaches after   drink  this detoxx changed everything  no headache after multiple drinks and no headaches the next morning either  all with no side effects  highly recommended 
not a cure for hangovers but definitely help,i ve been using this for about   months now and it is great  it definitely reduces dehydration symptoms  but doesn t help me with an upset stomach   the headache i usually get the next day after drinking  even with small amounts  is nonexistent with these  i ve also used this prior to plane rides to help prevent cramping  caused by dehydration   i would not recommend taking this on an empty stomach though  for me it makes me stomach gurgle some but it is more annoying than anything  this type of supplement is likely better with food anyway  i recently started trying to remember to take this as a daily supplement  i still forget a lot but i feel like it boosts my energy  the b vitamins are usually underrepresented in daily mulivitamins so i use this to supplement that  i have tried other  hangover  remedies  i wouldn t say this works better than the others but it is definitely more convenient  the others are powders you put in water  pills are just easier to take with you and no mixing involved and no overly sugary drinks 
pretty effective ,actually a very good product  i ve used it successfully several times now and have been able to avoid sudden hangovers and feeling drained in the morning when used accordingly  i m really glad to found something effective  only drawback is the slight pungent smell and taste  
best pre game hangover cure i ve used ,this stuff works great  i have been using it for a few years  every weekend  as long as you follow the dosage instructions  it works wonders 
absolute magic ,i highly recommend these supplements  they absolutely work  i have told all my drinking buddies about them and even shared them to show how amazing they are  they worked perfectly for five of my co workers after a fun thursday night  we all showed up for work on friday looking like we didn t have a sip  buy these 
never a hangov,i recently switched to this product when chasers became so expensive  the price was mush lower so i was a bit skeptical but bought them anyway  i can tell you that i am on my  th bottle  they work as well if not better in preventing the awful hangover the next morning  i would strongly recommend these to anybody who can t drink like they are    anymore 
highly recommend it ,this product really made a difference  i typically go out on the weekends and i use to be so exhausted and it made the next day very unproductive  since i ve been using this product  the next day is a breeze  highly recommend it 
honestly not sure if it worked ,did force me to drink water   which always helps 
life sav,have used these on several occasions  never disappoint  took a few bottles with us for my daughters   st birthday week long celebration  boy were these live savers  every in the party kept asking for some   highly recommend   
love this product,this sure does help with recovery from a nite with a little too many cocktails  i like getting the vit b s even if i am not drinking  
love it,i love this stuff  it is full of clean  natural ingredients that help to protect and detox your liver  and honestly  after a few drinks i feel fine the next day when taking this 
i won t say that i was at a      but way better that it usually is without the help of the    ,since i received this item i ve only been able to use it two times and it worked perfectly  i suffer from heavy hangovers which include headache  tiredness  nausea  etc  taking just the three pills before going to bed  because i forgot to take the pre drinking pills  eliminated all the typical symptoms the next day  i won t say that i was at a      but way better that it usually is without the help of the pill  i will definitely recommend this product 
solid ,pretoxx for hangovers     natural time release tablets with prickly pear  milk thistle and cysteine  i m not sure if this product works differently for people in accordance to their body chemistry but for me this was a life saver  i purchased this before i went to vegas for my bud s bachelor party and i am glad that i did  i took between     each night i was there and we all drank heavily  usually if i really tie one on i get body aches and my stomach is all jacked up the next day but i didn t experience that at all  as i read from most people you are still tired but i ll take that over a jacked up stomach any day  i recommend this product and i hope it works for you the way it did for me     i love vegas     
i now swear by this product ,i now swear by this product  it has already saved me from so many hangovers  i wake up feeling refreshed and good to go   i will be purchasing more of this product and will always keep it on hand  i wish i could give it more then   stars 
awesome hangover cur,works great 
buy it ,my friend had these and i tried them and they really helped so i bought some myself  i felt so much better after a night of drinking than i normally would have 
try it out if you have bad hangov,all i needed was to drink water the next day and i was set 
doesn t work  just drink water ,the   times i tried this  i actually had worse hangovers  what a waste of money  just drink plenty of water   edit  seller offered full refund since this didn t work for me  thanks 
worth it   ,this really works  my husband and i have tested it out  drank a few too many and no headache at all when normally would have had a headache  still tired but that s probably because we can t stay out late anymore  this is totally worth it 
good product,this is a very good product i usually dont drink heavy but i when i know that i am going to i make sure use the les lab detox  it has saved me a few times from bad morn
do not buy,this product is ineffective  i followed the instructions and used it   different times and it did not help at all  if anything i felt worse the next morning after drinking 
amazing product    ,i bought this for my vacation to sc  i m horrible at hangovers lately   this was amazing      wasting an entire day hungover is the worst  especially being on vaca where your days are limited as it is  i m ordering more today actually  highly reccomend this product 
definitely helps me ,definitely helps me  i was on a golf trip with the boys and we would have many beers each day  this product  and some pedialite  made sure i was good to go every day 
amazing ,i was a skeptic until i tried this  worked wonderfully   took   before and   after  i also had three friends try it as well   with the same results  highly recommended 
game chang,this is a game changer  follow directions and avoid the dreaded hangover after a night  or day  no judgement  of drinking 
i still wake up with a dull dragging feel,i have tried a number of products and keep coming back to pretoxx  while two glasses of wine is my limit  i still wake up with a dull dragging feeling  if i take a pretoxx and follow the directions with   per drink  i fell great in the am  even with three  it s my peventative remedy of choice 
i have to say that this is not a miracle pill that on it s own will eliminate all effects from drinking more than one or two gla,i was a bit skeptical about this product but after reading some the reviews i thought i would give it a shot  i have to say that this is not a miracle pill that on it s own will eliminate all effects from drinking more than one or two glasses of wine but i have found it does a great job of getting rid of that body ache feeling the day after  i found that this in combination with drinking a lot of water plus not mixing alcohols  i e  drinking spirits cocktails and wine or beer  almost gets rid of all the ill effects the next day 
this stuff works for preventing hangovers ,this product really works for me  i have tried a few similar products and they just didn t work as well as i had hoped they would  i m going to stick with detoxx for hangovers 
works as advertised ,great product  follow directions and see the difference 
worked great  could be that it forces you to drink    ,worked great  could be that it forces you to drink water since it says take with water but regardless  i did not have a hangover and will continue to take this when drinking large amounts  cheers 
great product,this is great  very little headache the next morning and i wasn t nauseous at all like i normally am 
works great ,i m getting older and sometimes after nights of over indulging  i ve suffered some pretty rough hangovers so i did a search of hangover products and saw pretoxx was highly rated so i gave it a try  i was skeptical but it really does a great job of mitigating hangovers after a night of imbibing  i ve now ordered several bottles since i found it  price is reasonable too  highly recommended 
great at keeping hangovers at bay,as advertised helps with not getting hungover the day after partaking too much grandpa s cough syrup 
hangovers be gone ,unquestionably  the best cure out there  the only drawback is that your overall sleep time is protracted   that can be a very good thing if you have to wake up in the a m  and not able to sleep in 
it works     ,all i can say is wow  if you are drinking hard alcohol this is a must have  literally got plastered last night just to try it out and it definitely works  woke up like nothing happened  felt great 
work,i have tried a number of hangover recovery supplements and this stuff actually works  i ve only taken it right before bed after a night of drinking and can definitely tell a difference in how i feel the next morning  will for sure be repurchasing 
reduced severity of headach,this did decrease the severity of the headache i expected to have by quite a bit  i will definately continue to take these before a night of drinking 
i would definitely recommend to anyone who doesn t want to be stuck in    ,went to new orleans for my bachelor party and this saved the day  it doesn t kill the hangover      but it does help tremendously  i would definitely recommend to anyone who doesn t want to be stuck in bed the next day watching netflix feeling like death
good stuff,great improvement   easy to take and it really helps 
the best way to prevent a hangover ,the best product out there  it usually takes me days to recover from only a few drinks  ordered these for a bachelorette party in vegas and not only was i able to survive  but i felt amazing the entire time  won t ever attend a wedding or day night out without these again 
don t hesitate to try these ,tried these out this past weekend and they actually helped  i m not going to sit here and tell you i had no hangover symptoms at all but these pills made it possible to function somewhat normally as soon as i woke up  after an hour or so of waking up i was close to      
sleeping pil,i decided to try these because they are almost half the price of a different hang over pill i ve used before  these have such great reviews  but i noticed a lot of people said they think these pills make them tired  i just tried these for the first time   nights ago because we planned on drinking a lot  i took them as directed  and i m not even kidding  i felt like i had taken a ton of sleeping pills  not only was i extremely tired after only a couple hours into the night  and yes  i passed out way before anyone else did   but i was still extremely tired the next day  the good thing was that i wasn t super hungover like i usually get  but i couldn t hardly stay awake the whole next day  i slept until just after  pm  when i had passed out the night before around   pm or so  while i m glad i wasn t super hungover  it isn t worth it to me to take these again unless i m just taking them because i ve had a hard time sleeping and need to catch up on some zzz s 
great product,my friend let me try this product recently for memorial day celebrations  after a long night of partying  i woke up functioning the next day instead of being sick and having a migraine  i had to get my own bottle  will not drink again without using this supplement 
works great as hangover prevent,worked great for me  i took   pills before a night of drinking  took another pill while i was drinking for every   drinks i had  and then another     before going to bed  and woke up without any hangover  i was super skeptical at first but so glad i tried these  i will definitely be buying more 
vitamin boost  but not a hangover cur,i ve tried these on a couple of different occasions  with heavy drinking  these didn t work  however i found these to help after a casual night out      drinks   i didn t feel any grogginess  which sometimes may happen  this is just a vitamin boost  which is kind of what i expected 
game chang,works great  i recommend these to anyone  they aren t a miracle pill and it doesn t make you feel      if you drink heavily  but it greatly reduces the hangover symptoms and makes you far more productive the next day  i went through my first bottle and am purchasing again  highly recommenced 
i m still tired the next day  but the vomiting headaches    ,i m still tired the next day  but the vomiting headaches are gone  i only take   at a time instead of    and it works well for me 
the best pills for hangover ,before knowing about these pills  i used to get very bad hangovers  i would drink many  many bottles of beer and would come home throwing up several times during in the predawn hours  it was really bad  i d take   pills of tylenol before going to sleep but that didn t work  i would still wake up with an extremely bad headache  after reading all the reviews  i figured i would try it out an hour before drinking  i took   pills before and didn t feel drunk at all  just a slight buzz  these pills were basically preventing me from getting drunk  while all my other friends were beyond drunk  i got home and took   pills and woke up the next day without any problems  no nausea  vomiting  or headache  nothing  i even tried it out drinking liquor one night with tequila  and another night with vodka  and no hangover  these are pills are gold 
i m am not a huge drinker but there are those occasions when the alcohol goes down a little too good  ,i have used this product twice thus far  i m am not a huge drinker but there are those occasions when the alcohol goes down a little too good    hello mardi gras  i have not had the symptoms that i would usually experience when over indulging  i will update as my experience dictate   
try it out ,i saw some good reviews for the product and decided to give it a try  went to the beach   all inclusive where the drinks flow freely and i can say that i felt better than usual the next morning  i still had to rehydrate well  but didn t feel as queasy as normal 
works well ,worked for me multiple times  imagine an all inclusive vacation    champagne brunch  frozen pool drinks  afternoon nap with beers  pre dinner cocktails  wine with dinner  and the occasional tequila or sake shot   brandy night caps  yep  this helped 
i wake up fine after a rough night of getting smash,honestly  these pills give a lot of relief for hang overs  i wake up fine after a rough night of getting smash
this stuff works great,this stuff definitely helps damper the severity of my hangovers  it doesn t get rid of hangovers completely  but i ve come to terms that there s nothing that will      get rid of a hangover  this product in conjuntion with water and electrolytes has been the most helpful of anything i ve tried  definitely will be ordering again 
good product ,i was skeptical at first but if you continue to use it consistently it actually seems to help  i ve been using it for   months now and if i remember to take it before an after a big drinking night  i wake up in way better shape than someone who doesn t  and it s suppose to help your liver not work as hard  i ll continue to use it 
ok,this product does seem to help a little bit with a hangover  nothing great but not bad eith
this stuff is great for reducing hangov,this stuff is great for reducing hangovers  make sure you take it before you start drinking  especially when you have a long day of partying planned 
would buy again ,i do believe these pills worked  being on a cruise and drinking heavily each day  i would have had some terrible hangovers  but i followed the directions as given and have no doubt these helped 
much needed help,definitely helps the next day after partying with the hangover 
miracle suppl,i head to vegas for a week every year for march madness  i don t know that i could have put this product to a tougher test and it really worked  went the entire trip without a hangover  i now never drink heavily without it  granted you re not going to necessarily wake up like you didn t drink at all  but its far from a hangover 
they definitely make mornings bear,i ve tried two or three different prevention pills and these work best for me  trickiest thing for me is remembering to take them at the end of the night  at first  i only took them on nights when i knew i d be drinking more than a few  i now take them any time i drink  even if i m just having one or two 
this product really work ,this product really helped during our vacation in europe last month in september with occasional indulged in our drinking    helps us continued with our next day journey with feeling not so hungover 
works   ,wine always gives me the worse hangovers  took three pills before a night out and felt completely fine the next morning with a minor headache that went away within a hour of waking up 
i think it actually works ,i m on my third bottle of pretoxx  as i get older  i m     my hangovers are way worse than they were a couple of years ago  and besides trying to drink lots of water i wanted to see if there was anything else i could do to prevent them  by hangover i mean laying in bed until mid afternoon because you feel so awful you can t imagine doing anything else  so i read up on amazon and decided on trying pretoxx  i ve been pleasantly surprised with the results  i have noticeably less nausea and that awful feeling where you can feel your heart pounding is totally gone  i still have a headache most times but that i can deal with  its the hangover  feeling  that i hate and i really think this supplement helps  it says to take      but since they re a little pricey i normally take   when i first start drinking and another a couple of hours later  i took them on my trip to thailand with me and my friends   i called them my  magic pills   oh  i also like that they re all natural  definitely worth a try if you suffer from miserable hangovers 
five star,great product  i will buy again 
pretoxx is awesome ,i rely on pretoxx  i take it every time i drink because i know i will feel fully recovered the next day  i recommend it to all my friends and family who complain about hangovers  as long as i follow the directions and drink enough water i always feel great the next day after going out  i definitely recommend that everyone give it a try 
thank you  this is going to make my weekend even better ,outstanding product from an outstanding company  packed with all of the vitamin b complex that you need to keep a hangover away  and they offer you a free bottle if you are new to the company  thank you very much  i will be back 
it help,great
this product worked great for me ,i was a little skeptical at first based on many mixed reviews  i recently went on a cruise and was planning on doing some drinking so i figured i didnt have much to lose  i have to say that this worked for me  i took this as the bottle said and didnt have any of my usual issues that i have when i drink  i am glad that i gave it a try because i will be making sure that is something that i will have on hand when i decide to go out and throw a few back 
no more hangov,this stuff really works  only take   in the evening  feel great the next day   
work,works great 
good stuff,this stuff actually works take to before you go to sleep to when you get up drink lots of water 
five star,works great  helps me be functional the day after drinking  better than just taking advil and chugging water 
it seem like i have more energy in the morn,i m liking this product so far  it seem like i have more energy in the morning 
pretoxx does a great job at keeping the nightly leg cramps away,i go thru electrolytes quickly when working outside  or partying to hard  pretoxx does a great job at keeping the nightly leg cramps away  also i recover from hangovers more quickly  
i think it s working   ,i think it s working   
all natural cure for headaches and grogginess in the morning after drink,i used to drink a single glass of wine and wake up the next day as though i partied all night  i found this product and liked that it was all natural ingredients to naturally help my body process alcohol  i use it now and feel fine in the morning  i won t drink now without taking these pills first  i highly recommend this product 
no more nausea ,i cannot believe these actually works  i was very hesitant on purchasing these but after reading all the reviews i figured i d give em a shot  going into my thirties i just cannot tolerate hangovers as gracefully as i did in my    s  recovering from those usually put me out of commission for a day or two  not with protoxx  as long as you follow the instructions and keep hydrated  hangovers will be a thing of the past 
works wel,works very well  i have tried a few of these supplements   this is the best yet 
i drink heavey on wk ends  this product will    ,i drink heavey on wk ends this product will work if used as directed also take with water trust me it makes a differ
it works    but don t expect miracl,some background on me  i m a    year old female  recently graduated from college and experiencing the awkward transition into adulthood  unfortunately  exponentially worsening hangovers are a product of this transition  pretoxx is great for those nights of casual  social drinking    as promised  you ll wake up feeling normal  which is great since these days i ll feel the effects of   beers the morning after  that being said   it really won t do much for nights of heavy drinking  think vegas  birthdays  general drunken debauchery   it s just an unfortunate truth  if you overly abuse alcohol  you re going to feel it the next day  and no miracle pill can change that  but for the nights you re not going balls to the wall  pretoxx is a must  i take it no matter what the occasion  what do you have to lose 
it works ,i have used this several times when i know i m going to be drinking more than usual and each time i m always surprised that i wake up the next day refreshed and feeling good 
very helpful ,loved it  went on a long weekend for a bachelor party and of course we drank the entire time  helped me wake up in the morning get a quick workout in and back to drinking  recommend 
effective hangover prevent,this product works  take a few before you start  drink some water as you go and have a few when you wrap up   that s my method and no hangover  works every time  capsules are pretty big  but no bigger than some vitamin supplements 
no hangovers ,great product and works well  yes  you still need to drink water  but it s effective for not having headaches and other hangover symptoms  love this product 
good product  great pric,i like it  no more feeling like crap the next day  cheaper than similar products out there   work
good stuff,we always take these with us on our weekend drinking events with friends  i m pretty sure they would work amazingly for just a couple drink but not      satisfaction when your putting back   plus drinks  overall a great hangover helping tool we use often 
new formulation is out of sight,ok  i officially love this  i think it works better in the new soft capsule  vs hard big pill  formulation  i also take  g buffered vitamin c  i also need to say  their customer service is awesome  i replied to one of those emails companies send when you ve bought something on amazon  asking what you think   i usually ignore them  since i buy way too many things on amazon to always do that  and lo and behold i get a reply about twenty minutes later  and a couple more later in the day  after i responded  it gave me the courage to order their allergy supplement  i asked about the selenium in the thyroid support supplement and they were very honest  saying i should check with my doctor  after telling me how much selenium was in it  if you have hashimoto s  you need to be careful about adding iodine and selenium  who knew  anyway  i love that if i email them i will hear back right away  i am getting old and hangovers can really almost kill me  but not now  
works depending how you drink   look no further    this is all you need    ,look it works but at different levels and depending on what you drink  on days of heavy drinking   half bottle of scotch and     beers  you will wake up ok and not too bad  what i did notice the hangover will start crawling up on you a couple of hours after you wake up  maybe it s the dose wearing out and a headache will be at your door steps  a couple of ibuprofen will take care of that  on days of normal drinking     pack of light beer  you will wake up like a champ   
it works wel,taking   tablets before  and then   after seems excessive and may be hard to time or remember     but if you do this the product works very well  i like it 
drank with confidence  continued responsibilities next day,i ve only used this one time and i drank with a little more ease and excitement for a work night  the next morning my confidence in not being a total mess at the office was greatly improved  i didn t feel as if i had nothing to drink but it definitely helped with the dehydrating and nauseous feelings 
good stuff ,works great  still not going to stop a hang over if you drink to oblivion  but really helps you feel better the next day  the older i get the more hangover help i need and this does the trick 
did not work,followed the directions  it didn t work for me  i tried it   times and finally just threw it away   
great product,if you re a drinker or just planning a night out give these pills a shot  just follow directions and you ll be golden 
certainly doesn t hurt ,it s hard to do a controlled experiment with these  i m not going to drink a set amount of drinks per night   i have gone through a bottle and it appears they are helpful 
noticeable difference  still need to try mor,i ve only used this once so far  but i would say it had at least a minor impact on how i felt the next morning after a night of drinking  if i notice increased performance over time i ll bump this up to   stars 
love the electrolytes ,i love the fact that this has electrolytes in it as well  i ll be taking this to europe with us as we eat and drink our way  the vitamins that are in it are also great and i love that there are no chemicals or weird ingredients in it 
i think it helped me not have as bad of a,it helps somewhat  i took   before i drank and   after drinking  i think it helped me not have as bad of a hangov
these work really well for me  i still am    ,these work really well for me  i still am tired the next day and have a headache  but it s nothing a little ibuprofen can t handle  pretoxx takes care of the nausea that totally debilitates me  i don t take as many as the directions say to take  sometimes i forget to take it beforehand or during drinking  but i ll take one before bed and sometimes when i wake up  it still works 
probably help a little but they are not nearly as good as other pills i have us,i used to be able to buy hangover pills at vitamin shoppe and they worked very well  these do not seem to do much  probably help a little but they are not nearly as good as other pills i have used 
does not work for me also not as cost effective as other products that work better considering you have to take three before you drink    ,not worth it  does not work for me also not as cost effective as other products that work better considering you have to take three before you drink and three after 
felt great the next day ,i have sometimes had a few too many and feel like crap the next day  and i felt great when i took this the evening i knew i was going out with friends  deserves   stars for sure   
item doesn t work,what a scam    of us took the item   followed the directions  did not help one of us 
use as direct,works great if you are diligent about the regimen  also use as a daily supplement and generally feel more alert and energized the mornings after  would love for the dosage to be stronger so as not to have to schlep   pills on my person when going out 
this really works ,i am generally a light dinker  i get a hangover symptoms from just   or   glasses of prosecco  my alcoholic beverage of choice   i don t know if it is the bubbles or what  anyway  i take   tablets of pretoxx just a few minutes before imbibing and i feel fine the next day  now  i make sure that i never run out 
i love these pil,i love these pills   i am not a drinker however i got them to cleanse my liver and i have noticed that i go to toilet more oftern when i take them  i used to take      pills    mins before breakfast  i noticed a slight improvement in my dark circles    
it works ,if you want to feel amazing the next morning don t drink  yeah right  if you want to feel way better the next morning take this  we aren t not going to drink  so take this 
five star,used it for a weekend in vegas no hangovers for me 
works ,went to new orleans and took these  had no hangover at all  i feel a little more tired when i take the pills but i d rather feel tired than have any of the other hangover symptoms 
it definitely decreases the hangover symptoms the day after drinking    ,it definitely decreases the hangover symptoms the day after drinking  prre toxx allows me to drink at will and with no worries about the waking the next morning  pretoxx for hangovers   liver support     vegetarian capsules    with prickly pear  milk thistle  cysteine   electrolyte blend        money back guarante
did nothing     we even took the instructions    ,did nothing     we even took the instructions as directed 
product works as advertis,so far  this product has definitely worked as advertised  the next mornings are not nearly as bad when remembering to use this product before and after consuming adult beverages 
i used it a few times and did the job    ,i used it a few times and did the job but i don t drink excessively so i am not sure how it would work after   or        drinks 
i would buy again,seemed to work  overall i would use the product again  i finished the bottle  the stuff tastes terrible and you will burp up the flavor every once in a while 
this product works   ,i had been experiencing headaches even after one cocktail or glass of wine but with this product  i feel great    even the next day 
still pretti,its not as effective as i thought it would be  other vitamins out there that you have to take less of a dosage are more effective than taking   pills of this product  still pretty dec
gave me the worst hangover the next day,can t tell if this had a placebo effect but it seemed to work until one time i puked it up after imbibing too much ever clear  gave me the worst hangover the next day  if you take this  don t puke or this will make it wors
great for after napa,i ordered these for our latest napa trip  we were very responsible but this was the cherry on top 
it works ,this actually works  i just take    or three  capsules before i go out for the evening and take   more when i come back home with   glass of water  i wake up in the morning and feel great     no hangover  i definitely recommend trying this out    it works great for me 
work,works as advertised  i m a little concerned about taking that much vitamin b  but i can t complain about the results  no hangover 
one star,does not do anything for hangovers   waste of  
does it make me feel    again ,you inevitably will age  and some of us don t want to face the facts  thus the need for this product  i ve started getting hangovers pretty much no matter how much i drink the night before  taking the recommended dosages of pretoxx the during the night of drinking really helps stave off the hangover  although  unlike other reviews  i still don t feel  great  the next day  just not completely useless 
miracles do come true ,works great  totally buying this miracle stuff again   
but heard it s the next best since they pulled ru   off the shelf,haven t tried it much  but heard it s the next best since they pulled ru   off the shelf  hope it work
works well ,this product definitely works if you take enough  i took one or two and drank heavily but woke up the next day with a hangover  the next time i tried three tablets about    minutes before i started drinking and the next morning while everyone was lying around on the couch  i was ready for round two  you may feel tired if you don t get enough sleep  but that happens when you re sober too  either way  it may be a little more expensive than advil  the next morning   but it beats having to wake up and feel completely horrible all day 
be aware of the science of it,amazing product  i had to leave a review because i saw all the negative reviews  but understand something about this product  it contains charcoal and will extract the firt and impurities in your pores  that means using it the first two weeks may make you break out because it is lifting the dirt deep down in your pores to the surface  my suggestion  use a facial scrub like deep apricot scrub from st  ives  after cleansing with this and then cleanse one more time and it should get those impurities out of your skin  this product cleared my face after one use  i kid you not  i have had blackheads my entire life  today  my second day of use  all of them are basically gone or so small you can barely see them  i have oily skin and have had acne my entire life and was never ever able to get rid of my blackheads ever  this is the only thing that has worked  i am in love with this product my skin is the best it has ever been  please do not listen to these bad reviews  they do not understand the science of the product  just use a deep sxrub after use and this product literally will work wonders on your skin 
after reading all of the positive reviews i decided to    ,after reading all of the positive reviews i decided to give this product a try  all i can say is it truly does work  if you take a directed i can assure you these supplement take     of hangover symptoms away  the difference is night and day 
this is a great product for heavy drinking night,this is a great product for heavy drinking night  you really wake up feeling refreshed and normal  just like you would without a night of heavy drinking  absolutely love this product 
great stuff  besides just being tired after a night    ,great stuff  besides just being tired after a night of drinking the headache and stomach nauseousness was never there 
didn t work for m,i felt like it made me more hungov
still experimenting with it      st attempt was success,interesting response  drank   bottles of red wine that normally would drive a serious hangover the next morning  first try at this experiment  took   pills and  oz water before after drinking wine  yielded a moderate response the next morning so did not have the raging headache  etc
haven t had a hangover since using this ,awesome product that works as advertised  just take   pills prior to and after intense alcohol consumption  and you ll wake up feeling like you barely drank  some people may have slightly uncomfortable reactions  i e  like feeling like they re on coke  a couple of my friends experienced this  but it wasn t too intense and they gladly accepted that over a hangover 
mornings after suck  this made it suck noticeably less ,we all have friends  we all like nights out with friends  mornings after suck  this made it suck noticeably less  thanks for that 
not just for hangov,i chose this for liver health  taking one a day as recommended  i picked this because the ingredient list is exactly in line with my do s liver supplement  but more affordable  i will keep taking  seems to be just what i need  do wish the name was slightly different though 
these pills work,shipped and delivered fast  the pills are great and work as advertised 
it works ,it works 
work,i have ordered this twice now  and am really pleased with the results  it does have a strange plastic like smell but works great 
i think it s good,i think it s good
love pretoxx ,love pretoxx     ive been buying it for around two years now  as ive gotten older my hangovers got worst and i needed a supplement to help the next day  pretoxx has fulfilled all my expectations  now if they can just form a supplement to pay for my bar tabs  ive also tried other supplements  dont waste your time  hope this helps everyone as much as it has helped me 
works for me ,i usually drink heavy especially on parties or vacation and this product works  next morning i feel much better than i did in the past without taking detoxx 
overall worth it,feel like it has really helped out  i put it to the test at least   times and woke up feeling pretty good  no stomach aches like i used to always hav
works way better than those garbage blowfish tablet,works way better than those garbage blowfish tablets  very important that you remember to take them before you drunk and when your night is done 
no day after symptoms ,i rarely drink too much  but when i do the next day i feel fatigued and shaky  i m in a general state of misery for the entire day  i ve tried pre toxx several times before and after drinking  and i have to admit i ve had none of the usual day after symptoms  seems to work for me 
it works ,i tried this when my friend ordered and it worked so well i had to buy my own bottle  get to enjoy the drinks and not have to deal with the hangover   
sort of works  you do still have drink your    ,sort of works  you do still have drink your water  this isn t a replacement for hydrating   and though you may still have a hangover the next day  this tends to cut down on the upset stomach factor of any hangover 
amaz,i cant even tell you how much i needed this in my life 
hit refresh on your bodi,amazing bounce back  feel rejuvenated and back to normal after a good night out with friends 
drank like a monster and didnt feel anything the next morn,this stuff actually works  used it on a euro trip with the boyez  drank like a monster and didnt feel anything the next morning    with water before going out and   with water when you get back  this stuff is amazing 
pre toxx really works ,this stuff works awesome  i went out for my birthday and drank a little too much  i woke up the next morning with no hangover what s so ever 
looks great so far ,i bought this for new years eve  so i have not used it yet  the packaging is nice and it came with a tag for a bonus bottle for new users  i will update my post after use  but i am happy so far 
works    ,works    you won t be sorry    
super happy to not have the dreaded stomach aches after    ,totally works     super happy to not have the dreaded stomach aches after a fun night 
does not work for m,i used these   separate times and had a headache after each use  with moderate alcohol intake  i do not recommend thes
has everything you want for an anti hangover supplement ,this supplement has worked really well for me so far  i bought one bottle weeks ago and just bought another  it can make drinking a  cleaner  and more comfortable experience for those nights where you are drinking a little more than usual  it has vitamins  minerals and electrolytes to help with nutrients you may have temporarily lost due to alcohol consumption  it contains milk thistle which is one of the most researched herbs around that can help with liver health  the supplement also contains nac  n acetyl cysteine  which is an amino acid that helps eliminate alcohol  primarily acetaldehyde  which is a byproduct of alcohol usage that can cause health problems and discomfort   all in all  i ll definitely be using this supplement some more and will probably order again one day 
i am impressed with this product,i woke up the morning after indulging in liquor  it almost entirely eliminated any hangover symptoms 
a neat product,this appears to help hangovers if taken correctly  though part of that is the inspiration to drink more water as well  either way  the benefits of the supplements involved are sure to benefit someone s liver  whether it s a die hard alcoholic or simply someone looking to keep that wondrous organ running like a well tuned machine  would recommend for anyone interested 
excellent hangover preventer that works ,this product definitely works  noticed a considerable difference the next day after a night out of drinking  would highly recommend this to anyone that is looking for improvement to feel better the next day after drinking  easy instructions to follow to use  after trying the product for the first time  i will never drink without using it 
pretoxx is a big help in the fight against hangovers ,this stuff really works  ok   i might not feel like a million bucks after a night of drinking   but i certainly notice the difference 
best hangover pills i ve tried so far ,i ve tried almost every detox hangover supplement available on amazon and this one so far has been the best  it won t cure a   day bender  but the effects of a night of moderate party are quelled substantially 
this product worked wonders on my   th birthday trip to    ,this product worked wonders on my   th birthday trip to vegas  my friend and i took for the four days we were there and we noticed a considerable decrease in any hangover symptoms the next day  i will never not take the pretox pills before a night of drinking again 
goodbye hangover ,definitely noticed a difference when taking it  this is the only supplement i ve tried so i have nothing to compare it to but i would say it works well  does not completely take away the hangover but i ve noticed a difference 
won t buy again but will try their other product,i ve replied to seller with no response  disappointing in that way and thst they really didn t do anything for me but possibly serve as a supplement to for my liver when drinking  i woke up once w no headache  cool  but couldn t get out of bed all day and didn t really drink like i used to on it  tried again the next wk and had a headache all day and could get up but was a lousy day  next try i added pediatrics electrolytes drink before and after drinking and it helped a lot  i m unsure i d up this again since seller hasn t written back and no refund available  maybe i ll try one of their other products  seems the reviews are great maybe it just didn t mix with my body 
you will feel much better in the morning than you otherwise would ,if you take this product as directed and combine with some common sense measures such as not mixing the kinds of booze you re drinking and having a glass of water here and there during your drinking session  you will feel much better in the morning than you otherwise would  i use this product regularly and highly recommend it 
worth a try ,seems effective  after some long nights  i ve been functional and ready to go the next morning 
works great for hangov,i enjoy my beer and wine but usually have very bad hangovers  the hangovers happen whether i have   drinks or     since using these my hangovers are greatly reduced  the ones from a few drinks are gone and the ones from excessive drinking are more tolerable and i recover quicker  i was a skeptic but these do work for me 
works as advertis,great product
this stuff works ,as someone who is getting a bit older and also has thyroid issues which relate to metabolism  i have found this to be extremely helpful when for those times when i tend to over indulge  i do not wake up with the headache  pain and nausea  i will keep be keeping this on hand 
two star,did not feel worse lol  but certainly not worth the money
this really work,i have used this product for     years now  and it works well for me  i ve always gotten hangovers  and they re getting worse as i get older  i d say using pretoxx eliminates about        of my symptoms  it s the only thing i found that  it s not particularly cheap  but for me  it s the price for doing business  and definitely cheaper than a drink 
it works ,this product worked pretty well with preventing a hangover  it doesn t take it away      but it sure makes a big difference  i would buy this product and use it again 
threw it away   ,the detox caplets where sticky and stuck together   didn t even try them    threw them away    very upset about product   
not worth buying ,i do not think it works at all 
great product,works very well  hate the after taste when drinking beer and you burp but other than that i love them and buy frequently 
 nd time purchasing  doesn t completely take your hangover away    , nd time purchasing  doesn t completely take your hangover away but definitely helps as i am getting up there in my years 
great product,product works wonders  highly recommend   
waking up refreshed not sluggish,this product certainly helps before and after a night of drinks with friends  waking up feeling refreshed instead of sluggish is a nice th
this is a great product and works as it say,this is a great product and works as it says  however nothing will prevent a hangover but this product really does help with the next day 
it works for me ,it doesn t take too much to give me a hangover  i can drink a glass of wine and be ok  but two  no way  i ll have a headache the next day  three  i m sick all the next day  since its no fun always being the dd  i have been trying remedies for years  this is by far the best  i take   pills with the first drink and   more if i m having more than    now i can drink three drinks and be pretty darn good the next day  i even got my mom to try it  she is even worse than i am with alcohol  so i blame genetics   and it worked just as well for her too  so try it 
it made no difference for m,i am not sure why i tried  there is no magic hangover pill  i suppose i really wanted there to be one  it had no effect 
great deal,after finishing my first bottle i can t imagine not having these around  even when im not drinking i still take one a day for my liver 
works great,this does the trick after an long night of drinking  i wake up feeling great 
it really works ,as i get older  it seems like it takes me longer to recover from an evening of drinking  pretoxx helps to replace the nutrients that you lose while drinking  therefore you have less  or no  hangover the next day 
surpris,work as advertised pleasantly surprised woke up clear and ready to go
works wonderfully ,i really like this product  when i remember taking it when i start drinking  it works wonders  it doesn t mess with my sleep and i wake up rested with no headache 
worth the buy  ,it seems to work the magic  my only ask would be to consolidate the serving size as   pills is alot to take during an outing  but definitely lessens the overall hangover effect 
works wonders ,i recently took a trip to jamaica with a big group of friends and knew we would be partying  so i made sure to stock up on some sort of hangover supplement  the red stripe flows like the blue waters of the caribbean and when you re at an all inclusive resort  it s easy to overindulge a bit  i took     of these every morning before we started each day  i made sure to stay as hydrated as possible  drinking a glass of water for each     beers  the main thing i noticed was when i woke up each morning i was absent of any sign of headaches  which is pretty uncommon for me the day after a night of drinking  certain mornings there was just a minute amount of nausea  but i think some of that was attributed to a lot of sun  jetlag and seasickness from a snorkeling trip we took    and of course the beer     while some of my travel companions were in bed  holding their heads and writhing with stomach cramps  i was out and about  swimming in the ocean and mingling with other travelers  if you plan on doing some drinking  whether it be just a night out with friends or a several days on vacation  do yourself a favor and try these  you ll be glad you did 
just don t overdo it and you will be fine  add a little water during the night as    ,works as it says  just don t overdo it and you will be fine  add a little water during the night as well 
i m buying mor,this product does seem to work when you follow the directions  i am going to buy it again 
very effective ,great product  i have used this product several times and the morning after results have been great 
well done ,this stuff is absolutely amazing  went out for a huge night last night and feel absolutely fine this morning after taking it all as directed  i m a bit tired but absolutely no other symptoms besides that to speak of  definitely buying more of this product 
works well ease my tummy   ,this product works very well  i have used it a few weeks ago from a friend and made it a point to order my own my biggest hangover problem is being nauseous and this product delivers  short duration of my hangover is a really good thing  i d recommend this product 
really work,good product
didn t work for m,i didn t notice any difference no matter how many i took before or after 
relief for a hangov,ok  i admit it  i have tried several hangover relief medications and this one works the best  if i remember to take it in the evening before i go to bed i feel ok the next day after too much drinking  even taking it the next morning provides great relief from a headache and clears up the nausea 
doesn t hurt and seemed to help,this definitely helped ease the pain of a girl s weekend in new orleans 
definitely does reduce the hangov,drank    hrs and woke up the next day almost       i stayed fairly hydrated  and repeated the next day and after that it definitely reduced the felt effects 
this stuff works ,it just works  and i feel great the morning after 
a must have for over    drinking haha,my friends live by this and gave me some last time we all went out  i had to get my own bottle as i have a vegas trip coming up soon  don t forget to take the  nd dosage at the end of the night 
really does help,i ve been using this product for years and love it  for  reasonable  amounts of alcohol  it really helps you feel better the next day  it s not a miracle pill though and at some point nothing is going to save you  for best results i try to take these pills and drink lots of water to help with the dehydration 
work,i bought these to take when i had my bachelor party  i took two with my second drink  two a few hours later and two more before bed  i woke up feeling a little groggy but no hangover  i also took blowfish upon waking up and felt great all day 
it works ,it works 
works like a charm ,was skeptical at first but after reading reviews these pills do the trick  wake up feeling great 
works ,seemed to work well  not all symptoms gone  but much better  took prior to drinking 
really just good mixture of ingredi,packed with nutrients  really just good mixture of ingrediants 
keep drink,great product  i cannot stop drinking as this protects me from the harshest of hangov
just ok,they are just ok  didn t do much for m
works wel,using pretoxx before drinking without a doubt made my hangovers less intense or totally nonexistant depending on how much i drank  obviously if you drink    beers you won t feel great in the morning  but no matter the scenario pretoxx made it bett
quality ingredients  most out of all the similar products ,packaging looks great and quality ingredients  i can not wait to try this product this weekend  i did a lot of research and this pill seems like the best choice 
great suppl,natural and easy way to promote feeling bett
work,felt great the day after a party drinking 
one star,doesn t work
works wel,i used to get individual bottles of similar ingredients  this product simplifies the relief 
will buy again,i will buy it again  depending on amount and what i had to drink  i would wake with no headache or a slight headache  but way better than being hungover all day 
liver support,i am hoping that this product provides the support to the liver that it claims  have not gotten lab work to determine 
it works ,works really well  i also started using in       doses rather than   before and after  its a good product and really makes a big difference 
the older i get the worse the hangov,as described  seems to help me  the older i get the worse the hangovers  this takes the edge off
good product   ,i ll definitely buy again  i went on vacation and use this product because i knew i would be drinking more than normal and it worked  there was just one day when i forgot to take it before i went to bed and felt a little sick the next day so i just took them when i woke up  i just recommend using as directed on the bottle   before drinking and   before you go to sleep 
still feel like death after boozing an entire night,doesn t work  still feel like death after boozing an entire night  maybe i m just too old for that now
probably made it worse ,does not work  probably made it worse 
its worth the money,good product 
seems like it helps my body process alcohol much bett,definitely could tell a difference  seems like it helps my body process alcohol much better  felt better the next day  take before and after with lots of water  and drink water throughout the night and you re good 
it actually works ,i can t believe it actually works  you have the sense that you drank too much the night before  but it s not nearly as sickening and painful as a real hangover  definitely recommend 
don t waste your money,this was horrible  you have to take to many pills and it didn t work 
love this product ,it really works  bye bye hangover 
vegas test,loved it in vegas trip  worked   nights of long nights partying and had hangover after the one night i didn t take 
good product,helps beat the morning hangov
works like you would expect to,doesn t remove the hangover completely but definitely helps the symptoms the next day 
this product works great for m,i take this product when i know that i m going to be getting after it  this product works great for me  just take   pill and a large glass of water about    minutes before it s time to party and your straight the next morning  it s better than wasting a beautiful day being hung over by far 
really works    ,i ve been taking this for a while when an out of town friend visits prior to an evening of cocktails  my friend has been supplying it  and it really reduces the effects of a hangover the morning after  i finally wrote down what the product name is and have ordered some for myself 
great product,this product really works  i drank all weekend for a bachelorette party and felt great every morn
i highly recommend this product,i bought this to take when i went on vacation in jamaica for a week  i knew that i would be drinking more than normal so i thought i would see if this worked  i took   pills before my first drink and then   pills before bed each night  i never felt hungover  not once  i highly recommend this product 
they work ,works as advertised  not miracle workers but pretty close 
no more hangov,i was skeptical at first but after   straight night drinking and popping these pills   i was fine n ready to work a    hrs shift  great product
say no to sick,solid product  helped me feel less terrible then next day
definitely a sav,works like mag
it works great ,great product  definitely reduces the icky feeling the next day  and definitely can tell it helps the liver out  highly recommend it 
great supplement   this was to referred to me by    ,great supplement   this was to referred to me by a friend and i was skeptical at first but if taken properly it definitely helps with not feeling awful the next day  recommend drinking water and eating before going to bed helps a lot 
    days in mexico i can verify that these are amazing  not a single hangover the whole tim,after   days in mexico i can verify that these are amazing  not a single hangover the whole time        would recommend and would use again 
works as advertised ,used this product just as directed before and after a    hour pub crawl  felt tired as expected after the day  but not hung over  after that i tried it for other parties and excursions  no nausea and very little  hangover  no matter how hard i went  i ve already purchased my second bottle 
it actually works ,so  my best friends bachelor party was coming up  i thought it would be kind of a good gag to buy some hangover pills to help us all start the celebration  i was highly skeptical of them making much more than a small difference  i was shocked to wake up the next day at  am after sleeping on my friends floor     feeling awesome  i decided that i needed to put this stuff through the real paces so i decided to use them at the wedding as well  starting at noon all the groomsmen opened the day off with bloody mary s  once the reception started i proceeded to switch off between beers and scotch  by the time the shuttle arrived at  am   i was pretty far in  so    took my last pills before going to bed at the hotel    and woke up at  am the next day     feeling wonderful  after a test like that i am convinced this stuff saved me from what should have been a day ruining hangover 
gives a terrible stomach ach,doesn t work at all  gives a terrible stomach ache 
one star,this product did not work for me 
impressive results ,i am very impressed with the results of pretoxx  i take   before drinking and     before bedtime   and i wake up with very mild  if any at all  hangover symptoms  love this product 
five star,so far so good 
works okay  but i think we all know there    ,works okay  but i think we all know there is no magics cure for a hangover  the hard part is remembering to take it
i like to drink wine and one night drank too much,it def works    after reading the reviews i decided to try it  i like to drink wine and one night drank too much  took as directed and woke up feeling fine the next day    have used on several occasions and the next day feel great   and i know i shouldn t  i wish i found them sooner    
perfect for vegas ,tried this out on a trip to vegas  worked like a charm  and i have been recommending it to everybody that i know 
life saver ,words can t describe what a difference this makes 
i am not a big drinker but like an occasional glass of wine and sometimes with just    ,i am not a big drinker but like an occasional glass of wine and sometimes with just   glass i wind up feeling pretty crappy and get headaches  this stuff works 
i love this product,i love this product  i get horribly  debilitating hangovers  i am not going to say that after using this product i was running a marathon  but at least i was able to get out of bed and function 
works very well for less than other brands ,works very well for less than other brands  highly recommended 
it works ,you still have to make sure you drink plenty of water  but this stuff works  i get terrible hangovers when i drink anywhere over   beers  i went to a bachelor party with some friends and  needless to say  there was way too much drinking  i took these as directed and i woke up every day feeling ready to go again  that is nothing short of miraculous for me  i will definitely buy again 
thanks les lab,no more ru     found this on amazon  have used it once and it worked  it contains l cysteine  valued for its ability to increase glutathione levels in the body  the  mother of antioxidants  
good so far,not too bad so far  have only tried it once but i woke up feeling hangover free after a night of some heavy drinking  had some nagging nausea throughout the day though  not sure if because of pretoxx or not  but will update review after a few more tri
definitely works better than any other product i have tri,definitely works better than any other product i have tried  even if you forget to take it before you start drinking just take a dose before bed and you ll wake up feeling great  i love this stuff 
works great,works very good for me  i take two pills before i drink and   before bed   i m good to go the next day 
drink them with water  not with beer lol,great product and it works  sometimes i forget the second dose before i go to bed but i wake up great 
so far so good ,so far so good  always hard to know what to expect  the next day   but i definitely feel like it s been better with this helping 
seemed to work,seemed to work  couldn t get anyone else to try it because of the smell  i drank a fair amount and felt mostly fine the next morning 
i have not been able to detect any effect or    ,i have not been able to detect any effect or benefit  i have used as directed   or   times without success 
worth it,worked for everyone that tried it in our group  we should have definitely been hungover 
definitely feel more energy and overall better even using the day after a night out,definitely feel more energy and overall better even using the day after a night out  i look forward to the results when taken beforehand 
works pretty much like it say,did exactly what the instructions says to do and did not feel the side effects nearly as bad  only took   pills each time instead of   based on other reviews  overall pretty happi
works great  used on a recent trip to new orleans    ,works great  used on a recent trip to new orleans and managed to avoid any hangovers  would highly recommend this product 
actually work,product works well 
it works ,it works  simple and to the point  it works 
two star,nothing mag
it work,product is great  but it s a little pricey 
this stuff works   ,there truly is a night and day difference with this stuff  i wake up without a headache and with plenty of energy  i never want to wake up after a night of binge drinking without having taken these again   
the real d,bought this for a vacation trip to cancun  it was one of those all inclusive deals so a lot of drinking took place  these pills are the real deal  i used them everyday i was there and had no ill effects at all  great product 
drink water with them at night before bed ,cool product definitely helps long nights of drinking  paired with water and sleep they work wonders 
pretoxx works ,i ve tested many hangover remedies and this is the first one that actually works  it will not completely eliminate a hangover but it will cut down on the severity a lot  i ve noticed that it will remove all the bad parts of a hang over such as nausea and headaches but you will still feel a little hazy the next day after a lot of drinking  this is my go to product before any kind of drinking  the friends that i have given pretoxx to often call me the next day saying how amazing they feel and ask where to buy the product 
it actually does work ,this stuff actually works  it is no  cure  for a hangover  but it does seem to help out after a night of having a couple too many 
nevertheless   highly recommend ,i took   tablets before a wedding reception that had a cocktail hour  drinks with dinner  drinks with dancing   you get the picture   and i was the only person who wasn t hungover the next morning  besides a pregnant guest   only downside   i was the only person who wasn t hungover  so i did   hours of clean up  nevertheless   highly recommend 
solid product,solid   works for me if i take it right before drinking 
one star,made me feel worse than a normal hangover 
i enjoy drinking very much and as i get older it s    ,it really works  i enjoy drinking very much and as i get older it s become harder for me to enjoy myself  if you take these according to the instructions you will avoid most of the nastiness from over indulgence 
hangover help is a good thing  especially on vacation ,the active ingredients are proven ingredients to nourish you back to health after too much partying  haven t put it to the test yet but plan to after a week in aruba next week 
excellent   really no hangov,a must have for a day of drinking really do miracles no hangover next day if you take it as directed this pills works end of histori
love it ,i love this product  i haven t had a single hangover while taking it  the one time i ran out i definitely paid for it  so i make sure to have these when i plan to have a drink or three 
great product and i will be order again,i ve been using straight milk thistle before and this natural blend with milk thistle and prickly pear is just that additional blend needed sometimes  great product and i will be order again 
for heavy drinkers    ,there is nothing to brag when you are drinking alot to get drunk  i know that when you drink a full bottle or more of hard liquor to yourself that you are going to feel it the next day which all my drinking buddies and i do  i usually woke up next day in need of soup  porridge  or some other warm soupy comforting food for my aching stomach   water  especially cold water did not do much to help  i have just received this product a week ago and tried it with my girlfriend  have drank three times heavily and have seen incredible results  mind you if you feel drunk and bad after a just bottle of wine or a six pack of beer to yourself then this product might help you a little  however  if you are a serious heavy drinker that can drink all night pounding drinks and wake up regretting how much you drank and wonder how you are still alive  this product works    you are not going to feel good the next day of course  but the headaches  from my experience was completely gone    if you have gone through a really bad hangover  you would pay more than the whole bottle price just to get rid of the nauseating  head splitting  painful  and unbearable torture you had to go through for what seemed like an eternity  and if you party every weekend and feel this after every night of drinking  you will know the difference between the hellish day after compared to the day after taking these pills  this gives you       doses since you take   pills every time which ends up costing       a night of heavy drinking  i have taken it   pills right before i drank  less than    minutes before  twice and felt pretty fine  my stomach did not feel dry  sour  and did not even need any soup which alone was amazing  have finished my first bottle in a week and am ordering two bottles more for my girlfriend and i  i am a regular amazon customer and have purchased many great items  however i have never written a review for any other item  these pills are amazing  for alcoholics like myself  the only thing i worry about is that these pills give me a piece of mind to drink even more     cheers 
i swear by taking these  don t get me wrong    ,i swear by taking these  don t get me wrong  you drink enough of anything and you ll be hungover  but these make me functional and ready to go again the next day  vegas and girls trip must 
make sure to take them,works to combat hangovers 
they work ,works amazingly 
one star,didn t work for me or seem any different 
good product,good product
works for me and i ve tried them al,pretoxx seemed to work better than most other treatments i ve tried for hangover  the secret is in the milk thistle   i will try this product again
